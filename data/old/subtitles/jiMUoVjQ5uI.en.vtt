I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS, LIKE, THE
LAST, YOU KNOW.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:29.889
AND I FIND MYSELF CHOKING UP
BECAUSE WE HAVE RAISED OUR KIDS

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.458 align:start position:0%
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:36.062 align:start position:0%
WE'VE HAD SO MANY AMAZING
EXPERIENCES.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.931 size:84% position:42%
WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL STAFF.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.967
WE LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH PEOPLE
WHO LOVE US AND CARE ABOUT US.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.903
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO BE
WALKING AWAY FROM ALL THAT AND

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.072 size:75% position:38%
IT'S JUST BEEN AN HONOR.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:50.043 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD TO
SAY TO THE KIDS, "BE PREPARED.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.845 align:start position:0%
THE NEXT HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO
BE LIKE THIS."

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.882 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY MADE MY KIDS START
PACKING THEIR ROOMS ALREADY.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.283 size:78% position:39%
IT'S LIKE, GET THIS DONE.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start position:0%
WELL, YOU KNOW.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.919
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU DON'T UPON TO
KEEP IT TO THE LAST MINUTE.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:03.089 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY THING SIF YOU DON'T PACK
IT, I'M THROWING IT OUT.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.157 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.992 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEN IT ENDS UP ON
E-BAY.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.827 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; IT'S ON E-BAY, I SELL IT.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:08.228 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.663 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.733 align:start position:0%
YOU IS WHAT IS BEYONCE REALLY
LIKE?

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.140 align:start position:0%
SHE'S-- SHE'S SO TALENTED THAT I
HAVE TROUBLE LOOKING AT HER

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.574
WITHOUT MY RETINAS BURNING OUT.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.344 align:start position:0%
YOU GUYS ACTUALLY HANG OUT LIKE
FRIENDS, RIGHT?

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.045 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK HER IN THE
EYE.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.413 align:start position:0%
SHE'S A SPECIAL PERSON.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.850 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO
BE BEYONCE'S BEYONCE?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.918 align:start position:0%
SHE LOOKS UP TO YOU.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.419 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE'S A SWEETHEART.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:33.953 align:start position:0%
SHE'S SMART.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.155 align:start position:0%
SHE'S CREATIVE.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.322 align:start position:0%
SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.224 align:start position:0%
SHE LOVES HER FAMILY.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.393 align:start position:0%
SHE'SA-- YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST A
LOW-KEY LADY.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.929 align:start position:0%
SO WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON IN
THAT WAY.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.531 align:start position:0%
EXCEPT I CAN'T SING.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.533 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T DANCE.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:46.866 align:start position:0%

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:47.567 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN DANCE.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.301 align:start position:0%
I'VE SEEN YOU DANCE.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.905 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOT LIKE BEYONCE.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.208 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS "ESSENCE"

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:55.475 align:start position:0%
MAGAZINE.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.412 align:start position:0%
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL--
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.581 align:start position:0%
TALKING ABOUT YOUR EIGHT YEARS
IN THERE.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:06.853
BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THIS PICTURE, WHICH WHEN IT WAS

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:10.089 align:start position:0%
RELEASED, BURNED THE INTERNET TO
GROUND, RIGHT THERE.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:15.662 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT--

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.997 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ME AND MY BOO.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.566 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU KNOW, WE LIKED
YOU ALREADY.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.268 align:start position:0%
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RELEASE THIS
PHOTOGRAPH.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.571 align:start position:0%
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SAYING TO EACH
OTHER THERE?

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.206
HOW DID THIS MOMENT COME ABOUT?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BARACK IS HORRIBLE
IN PHOTO SHOOTS, AND I HATE

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.313 align:start position:0%
DOING PHOTO SHOOTS WITH HIM, SO
I'M SURE RIGHT THERE I WAS

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.949 align:start position:0%
SAYING, "WOULD YOU JUST BE
PATIENT AND STOP.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.250
DON'T RUSH THE PHOTOGRAPHER."

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.053 align:start position:0%
HE'S LIKE, "I THINK WE GOT THE
SHOT.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.823 align:start position:0%
I CAN GO, CAN I GO?"
"NO, YOU CAN'T GO."

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.793 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS EXACTLY-- BARACK HAS
TWO SMILES FOR A PHOTO.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.262 align:start position:0%
IT'S LIKE THIS SMILE OR THIS
SMILE.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.698 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND HE JUST SORT OF LIKE, "I

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:52.532 align:start position:0%
THINK WE'RE DONE.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.433 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE IT."

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.536
AND IT'S LIKE, "NO, WE DIDN'T.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:58.805
THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS THEY HAVE
BEEN SETTING UP FOR HOURS."

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.141 align:start position:0%
HE COMESES IN AND SAYS, "I THINK
I CAN GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES."

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.844
I WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM TO
CHILL OUT AND RELAX, SO THEY

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:05.912 align:start position:0%
CAUGHT THAT DISCUSSION.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:09.849 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S WHAT'S

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.185 align:start position:0%
HAPPENING RIGHT THERE?

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; CHILL OUT.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
CHILL OUT.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.156 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "PLEASE, PLEASE,
JUST ONE MORE PHOTOGRAPH."

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.326 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; AND HE'S LIKE, "REALLY?"
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO IS IT HARD

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:23.196 align:start position:0%
TORE GET TO STAND FOR A
PHOTOGRAPH, YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:23.463 align:start position:0%
CHILDREN?

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.598 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OH, MY HUSBAND, WITHOUT A
DOUBT.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.766 align:start position:0%
WELL-- YEAH, HIM.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.500 align:start position:0%
HE'S TOUGH.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.137 align:start position:0%
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
HIM OR BO AND SONNY.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:31.804 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL?

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:46.953 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HIM.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:47.553 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, THAT SMILE,

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.656 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD
IMPRESSION OF YOUR HUSBAND.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.423 align:start position:0%
DO YOU DO AN IMPRESSION OF YOUR
HUSBAND?

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.293 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE ALL THREE OF US HAVE GOOD
IMPRESSIONS OF BARACK.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.028 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WOULD YOU MIND
SHARING A LITTLE BIT?

00:04:55.028 --> 00:05:00.800
&gt;&gt; IT'S USUALLYT DINNER TABLE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW-- MALIA WILL

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.003 align:start position:0%
START IT BECAUSE SHE USUALLY
ASKS SERIOUS QUESTION.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.305
"DAD, TELL US ABOUT YOUR KAY.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start position:0%
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION
ON GLOBAL WARMING?"

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
AND SASHA AND I ARE LIKE, "NO,
DON'T GET HIM STARTED."

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.516 align:start position:0%
AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, I'M GLAD--
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:23.523 align:start position:0%
LET ME JUST-- LET ME JUST ANSWER
THAT IN THREE POINTS.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:27.226 align:start position:0%
ONE--" AND THEN ONE-"A," AND
ONE-"A" AND "B."

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.063 size:81% position:41%
AND SASHA AND ARE LIKE OH!

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.965 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE,
PROFESSOR, CAN I AUDIT THIS

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:33.499 align:start position:0%
LECTURE?

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.570
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE SASHA AND I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT OUR FAVORITE SONG ON

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
THE "LEMONADE" ALBUM.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.809
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO THERE IS
THERE I HEARD YOU SAY ABOUT THE

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.345
PRESIDENT THAT HE LEAVES THE JOB
AT THE DOOR WHEN HE COMES INTO

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.546 align:start position:0%
THE RESIDENTIAL PART OF THE
WHITE HOUSE.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.613 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE DOES.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.015 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THAT REALLY
TRUE?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.717 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T LEAVE MY JOB AT THE
DOOR.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.752 align:start position:0%
HOW DOES HE LEAVE THAT AT THE
DOOR?

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.088 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AT LEAST OUR TIME
TOGETHER.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.090 align:start position:0%
WHEN HE FIRST WALKS IN, WE HAVE
DINNER.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.924 size:78% position:39%
IT'S USUALLY DINNER TIME.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:03.196
SO THAT'S THE TIME WHEN UNLESS
MALIA ASKS HIM ABOUT HIS WORK,

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:07.667 align:start position:0%
WHICH WE TRY NOT TO HAVE HER DO,
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KIDS, YOU

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.167 align:start position:0%
KNOW.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.569 align:start position:0%
"HOW WERE YOUR DAYS?

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.303 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S THE LATEST GOSSIP?"
HE'S REALLY INTO GOSSIP, SO YOU

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.376 align:start position:0%
CAN GET HIM-- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A LIFE.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.879 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, BUT HE'S GOT

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.549
THE N.S.A., AND HE CAN FIND OUT
WHAT ANY OF US ARE THINKING.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.925
SO BEING THE FIRST LADY, BEING
THE FIRST LADY, OBVIOUSLY, IS A

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.060 align:start position:0%
LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.162 align:start position:0%
IT'S A GREAT HONOR AT THE SAME
TIME.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:39.031
DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRST LADY--
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THE LAST

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:42.935
EIGHT YEARS-- DO YOU HAVE ANY
FIRST LADY FAUX PASS, LIKE "I

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.671 align:start position:0%
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MOMENT?"
&gt;&gt; SO MANY OF THEM.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.608 align:start position:0%
THEY USUALLY INVOLVE PRONOUNCING
SOMEBODY'S NAME WRONG.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:49.609 align:start position:0%
I'M SO HORRIBLE.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.177 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE YOU GO ALL
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.912
&gt;&gt; OH, GOD, NAMES ARE SO HARD.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.348
AND I PRACTICE AND I TRY TO
GET-- AND THEN I GET UP THERE

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.582 align:start position:0%
AND I MESS IT UP.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.751 align:start position:0%
EVEN NAMES HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.087 align:start position:0%
I MEAN, KIDS THESE DAYS, THEIR
NAMES.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:04.657 align:start position:0%
I MEAN-- I CAN TELL YOU, I THINK
I'VE GOT IT RIGHT.

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:09.729
I'M LOOKING AT THE NAME CARD,
AND IT'S LIKE, NO, IT'S NOT

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
TERRY, IT'S TER-REE.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.370 size:88% position:44%
I'M USUALLY JUST LIKE, "HEY,
SWEETIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING?"
