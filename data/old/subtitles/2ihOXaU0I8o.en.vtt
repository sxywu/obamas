[MUSIC]

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.111
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.190
Here we go, Michelle.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
There's coupons because you're gonna
need these probably, it's been a while.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.785
And you push the basket because
nobody's gonna push it for you.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.625
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; CVS of course.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.830
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; CVS stands for cotton,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.160
vaseline and stuff.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.660
&gt;&gt; No it doesn't.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.160
&gt;&gt; And-

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; That's not true.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.320
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.960
Do you want anything from the-
&gt;&gt; What are these?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.570
&gt;&gt; That's a personalized fan.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.583
&gt;&gt; This is a fan?

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:32.510
&gt;&gt; It seems like it is.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.458
Let's open it and see.

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:36.050
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This is new.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.770
Wait, don't!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.080
Ellen, don't open these up in the store.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.830
&gt;&gt; Why not?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.880
What if I don't like it?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.886
Well then let's put it back.

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:45.727
No, don't do that.

00:00:45.727 --> 00:00:46.715
&gt;&gt; Do you need coins?

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.650
Because there's a Coinstar over there.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.690
Ok?

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.420
See this is so good, I'm preparing you.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.290
Let's take a few.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.690
&gt;&gt; There.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.440
&gt;&gt; Ok, put them-
&gt;&gt; Wait!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.930
What if it's- Ok,
what are we gonna do about this money?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.809
This is, we got $21.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.701
&gt;&gt; The first lady is now up to $22.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.781
$24.25.

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:11.891
&gt;&gt; How do you know when it's done?

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.080
Wait don't touch anything yet until this.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.430
$45.17.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.990
This isn't cash.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.960
&gt;&gt; This isn't cash.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.315
This is a rip off.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:21.760
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.954
See, I told you.
You shouldn't have put all

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:23.596
those coins in there.

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.629
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:25.780
&gt;&gt; We should have started with like this.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.130
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.210
Is this the cash voucher?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.590
&gt;&gt; No, no, I know what that is.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.202
This is a debit thing.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:33.718
&gt;&gt; Do you have a debit card?
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, can you help us?

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:34.271
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Michelle.

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:34.969
&gt;&gt; This is Michelle.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:35.522
&gt;&gt; I'm Sapay.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.700
&gt;&gt; What did people, they called you
Michelle before the First Lady?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.290
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.940
&gt;&gt; Okay, Shelley.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.785
We're gonna call her Shelley.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Shelley.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.355
You slide it in, and
then you put your PIN number in.

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.890
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Turn around.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.003
&gt;&gt; PIN number nine, five-
&gt;&gt; Stop it!

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:52.665
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was just hard to cover-

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:53.716
&gt;&gt; Okay, checking?

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:54.493
&gt;&gt; Michelle?

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:55.548
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:55.548 --> 00:02:02.462
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.638
&gt;&gt; Wait.
Bernie Sanders.

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:04.228
No.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:05.264
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's not.

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:10.647
No.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.210
That didn't look like
Bernie Sanders to me.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.700
&gt;&gt; Not at all.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.450
&gt;&gt; No.
You can't get in here.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.170
This is locked.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.990
&gt;&gt; What's so special about this stuff?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.840
We might break it.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.188
&gt;&gt; How do you-
&gt;&gt; I didn't realize they got some.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.437
Let's see.

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:29.910
It doesn't make a noise.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.506
Hello?

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:33.830
Hello?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.565
We need help on aisle 2.

00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:40.812
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Customer service on aisle two.

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:41.508
Hi!

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:42.159
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Good, hi!

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.745
How are you?

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:44.522
It's nice to see you.

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:45.487
&gt;&gt; Hi, it's Shelly.

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:47.078
Hi, it's Ellen.

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:48.147
&gt;&gt; There you go.
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:49.274
Sasha needed some earphones.

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:51.381
I'm gonna get some for her.

00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:51.963
How much are these?

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.600
I'm just picking up stuff.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.070
What are you doing?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.670
&gt;&gt; I'm just scratching your back.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.818
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to focus.

00:02:57.818 --> 00:02:58.383
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.230
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not really itchy.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.436
I am looking for headphones though.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.080
What do you think?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.582
Do you think, could you chill out on
the itching and help me with this here?

00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:12.645
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Don't scratch him.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:17.960
&gt;&gt; You know this is,
this is not how you behave in a CVS.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.028
Stop scratching him.

00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:22.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Stop it.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.700
&gt;&gt; He likes it.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's good.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.610
&gt;&gt; Did that feel good?

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sure did.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.790
&gt;&gt; It was annoying to me.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.760
&gt;&gt; We are gonna get it cheaper.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.328
[MUSIC]

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:36.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.960
&gt;&gt; All right, here we go.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.045
&gt;&gt; Now, do you entertain trick or
treaters at your house?

00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:40.589
&gt;&gt; No.
I turn all the lights out

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:41.180
and I-
&gt;&gt; Man.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.680
&gt;&gt; I-
&gt;&gt; You should-

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.738
&gt;&gt; Close all drapes.

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:43.758
[MUSIC]

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.254
&gt;&gt; All right, magazines.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.370
Let's see, who's on it?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.560
Are you on the cover of anything?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.864
&gt;&gt; Let's see if they have Essence

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.356
here, okay?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.473
&gt;&gt; Here I am.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.600
&gt;&gt; There you are, with Rachel.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.648
What are you doing with Rachel?

00:03:56.648 --> 00:03:57.865
&gt;&gt; Do you have a magazine
I could be on with you?

00:03:57.865 --> 00:03:59.340
&gt;&gt; I thought you were my best friend,
no I have a television show.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.900
&gt;&gt; Here I am here we go.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.020
&gt;&gt; Do you want any of this?

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.000
&gt;&gt; Wine in a box.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.250
&gt;&gt; Yep, wine in a box.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.130
&gt;&gt; How does this work?

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.120
&gt;&gt; You just
&gt;&gt; How do you get it out of here?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.800
&gt;&gt; Like that.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.390
&gt;&gt; Wait really, where is the tab?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.480
&gt;&gt; Back here.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.450
&gt;&gt; We're not going to open it man.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.114
We need cups.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.351
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Get this one.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.710
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.890
[LAUGH] That's not a cup,
that's not an official cup to use.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.695
&gt;&gt; I think it is a cup.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.410
&gt;&gt; All right, six weeks after, you can
drink this for six weeks after opening?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.515
You are really not a good
person to shop with.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.895
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm a great
person to shop with.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.700
&gt;&gt; Does anybody know how
to open wine in a box?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.629
&gt;&gt; How do you open wine in a box?

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.111
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had wine in a box?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.000
&gt;&gt; You with the baby, come over here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.350
You need wine more than anybody,
you have a brand-new baby.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.740
&gt;&gt; So put the cup under so
it doesn't start to pour on the ground.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.335
&gt;&gt; That's a good-
&gt;&gt; And then you just turn it.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.854
&gt;&gt; Turn it.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.786
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Yep, there you go.

00:04:57.786 --> 00:04:58.630
&gt;&gt; Okay, here you go.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.200
Who wants wine?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.082
Anybody, anybody, all right.

00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:03.948
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's good, that's good.

00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:04.630
What's your name?

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.357
&gt;&gt; My name is Jacquelyn.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.914
&gt;&gt; Jacquelyn.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.730
&gt;&gt; Sign this.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.750
&gt;&gt; All right, Jacquelyn.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.285
&gt;&gt; Shelly and
I just signed the box of wine for you.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.660
&gt;&gt; You're so nice.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.290
&gt;&gt; Ellen, look at this baby.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.195
&gt;&gt; Let's sign the baby.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.185
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Just sign the baby.

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.205
&gt;&gt; You want us to sign the baby?

00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:23.920
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Aw.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.342
&gt;&gt; Avery is beautiful.

00:05:25.342 --> 00:05:26.249
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.314
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She's out of control.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.550
&gt;&gt; Don't you want me to sign the-
&gt;&gt; You were about to head for

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.310
the forehead.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.415
&gt;&gt; And then I go down, like that.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.455
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; My, thank you.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.140
Not, not no, don't do that.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.804
&gt;&gt; Go to sleep.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.408
Go to sleep.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.904
&gt;&gt; You should go now.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.671
She's up, you woke her up.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.129
&gt;&gt; Go to sleep little baby.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.317
Go to sleep.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.117
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're scaring her.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.810
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.030
&gt;&gt; You open it, you-
&gt;&gt; Michelle what kind of cream do you need

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.736
for that rash that you
were telling me about?

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.004
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The rash?

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.862
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We need a rash for

00:06:08.862 --> 00:06:11.962
a rash that Shelley has.

00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:14.229
Where is the rash?

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.722
What area were you telling me about?

00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:16.475
&gt;&gt; My shoulder.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.630
&gt;&gt; Lower than that.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.685
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; A book.

00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:23.675
&gt;&gt; Get this.
Lindsey Sands, Lady Pirate.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.550
&gt;&gt; Wow, look at this.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.550
&gt;&gt; Let's read some.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.570
&gt;&gt; The water was flat as a looking
glass capturing the moonlight and

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.670
stars that twinkled down from above and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.570
reflecting just enough light that
the ship gliding ahead- I don't know.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.420
&gt;&gt; Alright, we're gonna head
to self checkout over here.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.050
&gt;&gt; Alright.
Well wait.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.031
Do you know what you're doing?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.749
&gt;&gt; No but I guess you scan it.

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.070
&gt;&gt; Do you have your extra care card?

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.870
&gt;&gt; Where are you?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.090
&gt;&gt; Do you have an extra care card?

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.590
&gt;&gt; Jose?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.140
Jose.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.930
&gt;&gt; Alright, we're checking out now.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.721
&gt;&gt; Jose, can you see?

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:57.179
&gt;&gt; Yes, I can see.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.380
&gt;&gt; Jose, can you see if you can help us?

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.281
We don't know what we're doing.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.839
&gt;&gt; I've never done self checkouts.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.910
&gt;&gt; Can you just give it to us?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.013
We are both very busy with...

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.017
&gt;&gt; No, we're going to pay!

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.680
We're going to pay.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.100
No!
No, we can't take bribes,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.153
I work for the government.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.242
&gt;&gt; It's not bribes,
it was just a question.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.711
&gt;&gt; And you could just set it here.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.215
&gt;&gt; I'm good at this, this is good.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.038
&gt;&gt; I'm good at bagging!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.651
&gt;&gt; Alright!
&gt;&gt; Please place your item in the bag.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.210
Please do not place your
item in bagging area.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.350
&gt;&gt; I think you're too

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.910
close to the bagging area.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.450
&gt;&gt; How do we know that we got?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.261
Okay, we got Macy's card in,
but I don't see the stub.

00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:29.045
[SOUND] Okay, here we go.

00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:29.844
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:07:29.844 --> 00:07:30.968
&gt;&gt; I don't wanna be too close.

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:32.312
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't be too close.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.746
You're messing it up.

00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:34.600
You have to put the amount in.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.927
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.876
&gt;&gt; $10.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.461
&gt;&gt; $10, okay.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.537
&gt;&gt; Zero, zero, zero.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.443
&gt;&gt; Enter.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.117
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.372
&gt;&gt; Good job.
&gt;&gt; Are you bored Ellen?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.247
&gt;&gt; I sure am.

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:49.845
&gt;&gt; Come on it's fun, this is the process.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.137
&gt;&gt; OK.
&gt;&gt; There it goes!

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.318
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.418
&gt;&gt; I'm getting tired, I'm so confused.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.417
&gt;&gt; Just hit no!

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.220
&gt;&gt; Skip bagging?

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.084
&gt;&gt; What are you doing?

00:07:57.084 --> 00:07:57.613
&gt;&gt; I don't know, I just...

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.478
&gt;&gt; We're not done yet!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.125
&gt;&gt; I was angry.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:07:59.994
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.265
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:02.093
I just got sick of it.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.048
&gt;&gt; Finish and play.

00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:05.879
Okay.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.300
Why am I the only, did we pay for that?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.434
&gt;&gt; Uh-uh.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.031
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.717
&gt;&gt; Man!

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.390
I'm working really hard here, Ellen,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.966
and you're just standing around.
I'm really exhausted.

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:16.565
Here, take these.

00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:18.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's put the magazines here.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.147
All right, who's paying?

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.198
I don't have any money.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.785
&gt;&gt; Man.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.083
&gt;&gt; You have money?

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.612
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.763
This is a lot of work!

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.742
&gt;&gt; Can you get my face on money?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.558
&gt;&gt; No I can't.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.662
&gt;&gt; Why not?

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.292
&gt;&gt; We don't do that, you would
have to have done something grand!

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.871
Like Harriet Tubman.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.990
&gt;&gt; I make the world happy every day.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.969
&gt;&gt; You should have freed some slaves.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.250
You know you're really annoying.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.880
It's like taking
a three-year-old to the store.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.150
&gt;&gt; Not everyone does everything for
you anymore.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.040
&gt;&gt; Well obviously not!

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.648
I mean this was hard!

00:08:54.648 --> 00:09:00.322
Here just take this stuff.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.535
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.101
I'm gonna be back, 2017.

00:09:07.101 --> 00:09:09.523
I'm coming alone without Ellen.

00:09:09.523 --> 00:09:10.511
&gt;&gt; No, I'm gonna come back with you.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.514
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This was so much fun.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.139
&gt;&gt; I'm not taking you anywhere, you're.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.096
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
