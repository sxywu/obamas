00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.680
Do you look at what's going
on now in the campaigning and

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.135
do you miss it any way and do you look at
them and go, you're making big mistakes?

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:12.545
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
I don't miss it.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:16.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's always good to get

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.250
out of Washington, which can
sometimes be a little depressing.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.588
What will, to get out of Washington or
to, what part is depressing?

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:29.422
&gt;&gt; Well, Washington.

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:31.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's, I would think so.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.643
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:33.400
&gt;&gt; I mean, really.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, but-
&gt;&gt; You're probably not kidding-

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.710
&gt;&gt; I'm kinda not kidding.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,
what was the biggest surprise for

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.820
you when you became president,
what surprised you the most?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.650
Well, the fact is that

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.500
most of the time if something reaches
my desk, it means it's really hard,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.720
which is why they bumped it up to me
cuz nobody else could figure it out.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.960
And when I came in,
the economy was collapsing.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450
We were about to go into
a great depression.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.790
We had to make a whole bunch of decisions
about saving the auto industry or making

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.110
sure that business has got back on their
feet, or the housing market would recover.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.230
And you're having to make big
bets with incomplete information.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.020
You're not sure that
everything's gonna work.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.240
And I think that part of what's
happened in this Instagram.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.450
You know, Twitter culture is
that we expect quick answers

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.000
without sacrifice, without having to make
choices, and politicians play into that.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740
But the truth of the matter is, you know
the world is a big complicated place.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.340
The good news is that we're generally
going in the right direction,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.830
and my hope is that
we'll continue to do so.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.490
&gt;&gt; That's everybody's hope,
but let's talk about me.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.225
I feel like.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:57.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Don't you think if more people danced.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And just had fun instead of,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.130
everyone takes everything so seriously and
I think that we have these people,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.620
I'm kinda kidding there, obviously,
but I think we have people that

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.450
we all have the one thing in common which
is we just want a good quality of life.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.050
&gt;&gt; Right.
And

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.990
then we had these people that feel one
way and if someone feels another way,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.950
we tend to hate them and it's just-
&gt;&gt; That's not helpful.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.090
&gt;&gt; No, it's not helpful.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.780
&gt;&gt; The amount of stuff that is just
put out there on the internet or on

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.440
sometimes news broadcasts that are just
factually inaccurate, is surprising.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.760
And it's really hard to catch up.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.060
Since I came into office,
we reduced the deficit by two thirds.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.830
But if you ask the average person,
they're sure that spending has shot up.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.220
And the reason is because there
are a bunch of folks who say that.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.200
We're wildly overspending
even though we aren't.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.370
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And that's just one small example, but

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.600
it happens all the time.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.330
And that's something that we have to fix
partly by people paying more attention

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.220
to what's going on every single day.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.970
And it's hard because people are busy.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.940
They're dropping off their kids,
they're working.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.720
They're, you know, trying to figure
out how they get some exercise,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.170
do some push ups and.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.520
&gt;&gt; Speaking of her.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.125
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What do you and Michelle disagree on.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:23.960
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.710
&gt;&gt; Like what do you fight about.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.330
&gt;&gt; After about, 15 years

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.100
I finally figured out
that she's always right.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.870
So.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.740
&gt;&gt; So then surprisingly we just

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.450
stopped fighting.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.155
&gt;&gt; And there's no more fighting.

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:42.810
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well, she's a cheater,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.330
you know that,
when you talk about the push ups.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.585
I'm not even gonna,
I'm not gonna argue about it anymore.

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:49.619
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But she's a cheater.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.970
So look at how far down I went,
and look how-

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.240
&gt;&gt; You're so upset about that.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.820
&gt;&gt; I am so
because she didn't go down all the way and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.010
she claimed she had longer arms and
so she's, listen,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.210
it was very impressive that she kept going
but she didn't go down as far as me.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Look at, look.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.950
&gt;&gt; She's going down pretty far.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.690
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.555
Not as far down as me.

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:12.080
[LAUGH] Look.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.800
&gt;&gt; I mean those are good,
you have good form.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.377
&gt;&gt; I have better form than her [LAUGH] and
I.

00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:20.214
&gt;&gt; You have good form.

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.160
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.247
Listen.
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:26.386
