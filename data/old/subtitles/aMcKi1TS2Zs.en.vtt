00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.771 align:end position:100%
that you said, "Democracy
requires compromise

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.774 size:63% position:69%
even when you're
100% right."

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.741 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.210 size:63% position:69%
Did you get that
from Michelle?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.479
Because I think --
I've been married a few years.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.784 size:72% position:36%
That was a marital tip,
as well as --

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.719 align:start size:94% position:6%
as well as a tip
about democracy.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.288 align:start position:0%
You know, it's true.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.924 size:78% position:39%
The point I was making --
I made a couple points.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:31.030 size:75% position:38%
One is despite the news,
despite all the rancor,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.765 size:66% position:33%
the truth is,
if you had to be born

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.199 size:63% position:31%
at any time
in human history

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
and you didn't know who you
were going to be ahead of time,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.640 size:78% position:39%
you didn't know you were
going to be Jimmy Fallon,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.041 align:start position:0%
you would choose now,

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:47.046 align:start position:0%
because the world is actually
healthier, wealthier,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.215 size:63% position:31%
better educated,
more tolerant,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.584 size:69% position:34%
less violent
than it has ever been.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was in Hiroshima

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.423
and thinking about the fact that
during a five-, six-year span,

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:00.526
60 million people were killed
around the world.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.228 size:75% position:38%
I mean,
it was just devastation.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.196 size:75% position:38%
And for all the problems
we've got now,

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.298 size:88% position:44%
what I wanted to communicate
to folks was,

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.100 size:63% position:31%
there's a reason
to be hopeful.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.703 align:start position:0%
We've got challenges,
but we can deal with them.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:11.737
What we also have to do, though,

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:12.805 size:66% position:33%
if we're going to
deal with them,

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.474 align:start position:0%
is we have to recognize

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.811 align:start position:0%
that democracy means you don't
get everything you want

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.880 size:63% position:31%
when you want it
all the time.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.717
And, you know, this is something
you're teaching your 3-year-old,

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.953 align:start position:0%
but somehow Congress
sometimes doesn't get it.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:33.059 size:88% position:44%
Sometimes in our politics,
we expect to get everything.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:36.396
And this is a big, complicated,
diverse country.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:40.499 align:start position:0%
And we've got to be able
to talk to each other and listen

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.637 size:84% position:42%
and occasionally compromise
and stay principled

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.907 align:start position:0%
but recognize that it's
a long march towards progress.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.175 align:end position:100%
Speaking of compromise,
when you leave the White House,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.512 align:end position:100%
you're going to have to kind of
compromise a little bit.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.180 size:66% position:67%
Like, do you remember
how to do stuff?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.881
[ Laughter ]

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.184 size:59% position:70%
Do you take money
out of the ATM?

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.020 size:66% position:33%
The ATM thing
I remember.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.523
Pressing buttons on elevators
I'm worried about.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.692
[ Laughter ]

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.261 size:81% position:59%
It's gonna blow your mind.
It's really fun.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.195 size:63% position:69%
It lights up.
It's really fun.

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:12.698 align:start size:91% position:9%
You know, look,

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.501 align:start position:0%
I was this cool high-tech guy
when I got there, right.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.037 align:start position:0%
And I was the first President
to have a BlackBerry.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.373 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so years pass.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.542 align:end size:59% position:59%
And no one else
has BlackBerrys.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
And, you know, I've still got
the clip on the belt.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:26.913 align:start size:56% position:44%
Oh, my goodness.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:31.551 size:78% position:39%
Right, and then, finally,
this year,

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.285 size:69% position:34%
they said, "Good news,
Mr. President.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.987 size:72% position:36%
We're going to give you
a smartphone

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.022 size:78% position:39%
instead of a BlackBerry."

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.390 size:81% position:41%
I thought,
"All right, this is cool."

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.058
I've been seeing Malia and Sasha
doin' all this.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.927
Michelle's got three of them.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.895 align:start size:88% position:13%
She's texting
and all this.

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.797 align:start size:91% position:9%
So I'm excited.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.032 size:88% position:44%
I get the thing, and they're
like, "Well, Mr. President,

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:49.335 align:start position:0%
for security reasons --

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.471 size:66% position:33%
It's a great phone,
state-of-the-art,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.241
but it doesn't take pictures,
you can't text,

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.310 align:start position:0%
the phone doesn't work,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.312 size:72% position:36%
you know, you can't
play your music on it."

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:02.281 size:78% position:39%
So basically it's like --

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.350 size:78% position:39%
Does your 3-year-old have
one of those play phones?

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.985
[ Laughter ]

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.887 align:end position:100%
That's what they gave
the president of --

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.123 size:66% position:33%
It's got, like,
the stickers on it.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.224 align:start position:0%
So you're all like...

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.925 size:59% position:70% line:91%
I'm going to call
Minnie Mouse.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
Hi!

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.127 size:63% position:69%
Hello, Minnie Mouse.
Are you there?

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.262 align:start position:0%
Your imaginary friend.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.730 size:66% position:33%
That's basically
the phone I've got.
