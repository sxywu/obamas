00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.450
You golfed with Barack, right?

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; I have a good time with Barack.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.081
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he spends a lot of
time golfing with my husband.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.079
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what
he said on the course.

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:08.429
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.
&gt;&gt; So he knows, he knows.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.700
&gt;&gt; So who's a better golfer?

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen.
&gt;&gt; I'm a better golfer.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.000
But obviously in golf, you play with
the handicaps and everything, so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.570
everything's pretty fair.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.650
The last two times I've played,
I've lost to him.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.540
&gt;&gt; What's your handicap and what's his?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.175
I'm a two,
I can't disclose that information.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:28.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What is your handicap?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.280
&gt;&gt; I'm a two, I was told not
to disclose that information

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.310
on our president [INAUDIBLE]
that's top secret.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, it's top secret.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.230
&gt;&gt; I'm acting like secret service so
that's top secret.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.241
&gt;&gt; But two,
that's amazing that you're a two.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.960
&gt;&gt; That's pretty good, I didn't have
my A game when I played him both times.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.788
But I really wanted it.

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:48.120
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; He's a trash talker though right?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.730
&gt;&gt; He is, but you know how he is.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.742
&gt;&gt; Trash talker.

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:51.728
&gt;&gt; During his speeches, he has like this,

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:53.158
they are kind of a slow cadence,
that kind of draws you in.

00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:57.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah we know [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; He brings that same kind of vibe to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.467
his trash talk, so
I'll hit a shot out of bounds and

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:05.292
he'll just look like yeah,
that's not a good shot.

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:08.095
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I gonna need you to do

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:08.670
better next time.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
So it gets under your skin too,
cuz I know, I hit it out of bounds.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.958
&gt;&gt; You should trash talk back, Stephen.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.191
&gt;&gt; Give him some things to say.

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:20.079
&gt;&gt; Talk about his ears.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.606
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Here's one, here's one.

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:26.860
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE] [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; As you're putting, you wanna say,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.365
the shadow from your ears,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:33.432
&gt;&gt; Is really messing up my putt.

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:35.430
[LAUGH] Try that one.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.955
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you'll say that.

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:41.281
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:42.105
&gt;&gt; That is low.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:44.696
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's what trash talking is.

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:45.673
&gt;&gt; That's what trash talking is.

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:48.256
&gt;&gt; That is the trash part of the talking.

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:49.569
&gt;&gt; That's not fair though,
he has 50 secret service out there so

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.024
if I trash talk, he just gives them
the look and then I'm out of there.

00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:51.660
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.810
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And we never see you again.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.770
We don't know what happened.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.718
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Last we saw you play golf.

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.698
Let's talk about what
you're doing together.

00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:01.218
You're doing something called Drink Up.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.920
Which, I love that you're
doing something about water.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740
Because I am a big fan of water.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.230
I think everyone should drink water.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.000
It's good for you in so
many different ways.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.810
It flushes out all the bad stuff.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.267
It's good for you, it's better for

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.476
you than anything else that you could
possibly drink, so tell us about Drink Up.

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:17.638
&gt;&gt; You said it best.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:18.850
&gt;&gt; Really.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.494
&gt;&gt; It's like, duh.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.284
&gt;&gt; It's true.

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:24.414
&gt;&gt; Teaming up with our first lady and
my partner Brita to encourage families and

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:28.737
kids to drink more water, more often,
and giving them an affordable option for

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:30.175
better tasting water so.

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:33.429
&gt;&gt; And one thing I'm so
proud about with you, Stephen,

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.708
is that you have- you are supporting
water, fruits and vegetables.

00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:42.202
I mean, you are stepping up and
endorsing things that are healthy for

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:43.532
kids and families.

00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:47.234
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Our audience can drink more great

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.930
tasting water with their
Brita water filters and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.176
a $200 American Express Gift Card.

00:02:52.176 --> 00:03:01.277
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
