00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.400
Welcome back to the show. Here at Full Frontal we have a long

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.210
tradition going all the way back to our

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.340
first season where I sit down and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.570
interview the president of the United

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.240
States before he or she leaves office

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.200
this week it was President Obama's turn

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.550
thank you so much for joining us for our

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.190
annual Halloween presidential interview

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.320
(OBAMA) it is so exciting!
(SAM) this here I'm going as a witch

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.540
(OBAMA)  that's not a witch costume

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.860
(SAM) I'm a woman on television and I'm over 40, so

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.640
I'm already in costume

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.530
(SAM) where's yours?
(OBAMA) I'm dressed up as what

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.410
happens when young people vote

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.760
Someone gets really old really fast?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.610
(OBAMA) that's not it.
(SAM) so is that like white

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.120
spray paint or fun Halloween cobwebs up there?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.379
Sam I'm still president for

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.599
about three months

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.600
Careful.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.320
look Sam, the reason I'm here is not just

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.260
to celebrate Halloween with you but it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.360
is actually because i want to let

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.640
first-time voters know why it is so

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.740
important to vote. This is probably the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.140
most important election of our lifetimes

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.750
the choices could not be clearer and if

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.430
we want to build on progress, on issues

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.520
like climate change and gender equality

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680
and making sure that everybody has

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.690
healthcare and making sure that young

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.190
people have a good education and can

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.180
afford College

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.380
they've got to make sure that their

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.080
voices are heard.
(SAM) So you are a father of a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.990
college student, sitting down with a 47

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.729
year old mother of three

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.880
if this was your best idea to get young

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.470
people to vote, what was your worst idea?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.670
Have you thought about going on antiques roadshow?

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.530
I haven't, but it turns out that young people actually are more

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.179
interested and engaged than I think we

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.440
give them credit for. Sometimes they

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.959
get cynical... hard to understand why

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.550
after watching this campaign. But Malia,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.740
my oldest, she actually voted for the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.440
first time. The the pride that she took, I

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.360
think in casting her ballot, is a pride

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.369
that I think a lot of young people feel

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.720
but you got to talk to 'em about the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.049
things that they care about.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.020
Talk to me as though I'm a millennial voter and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.500
get me interested in voting

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.560
Okay because it's like,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.450
I don't even know if there is like any

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.100
point in voting and like

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.100
they're both so totally flawed, like

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.560
don't you even think it's time to like

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.110
upend the whole system and just like

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.120
break everything

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.340
first of all if you're worried about

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.510
whether you can afford to go to college

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.420
or not then Hillary Clinton's got a very

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.850
specific plan and Donald Trump doesn't. If you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.470
care about climate change

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.230
that's not a small thing. so young people

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.550
have a bigger stake in this election

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.130
than anybody, I would hope that you'd be

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.560
willing to take about the same amount of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.800
time that you spend just looking through

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.350
cat videos on your phone to make sure

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.390
that the democracy's working.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.220
Sorry, I was just snapchatting myself as a bottlenose dolphin

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.560
If and when Hillary is president,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.880
what do you think will be the female

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.480
equivalent of "you weren't born in this country"?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.820
That's an interesting question

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.670
thank you, I have a lot of those

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.340
I think the equivalent will be she's tired, she's

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.400
moody, she's being emotional

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.020
it's just something about he. There's

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.850
something about her. When men are

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.550
ambitious, it's just taken for granted, well

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.200
of course they should be ambitious. When women

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.460
are ambitious, why? that theme, I think will

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.370
continue throughout her presidency and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.930
it's contributed to this notion that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.010
somehow she is hiding something

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.950
what a nasty woman

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.060
After you leave office

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.920
have you thought of just whispering in

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.000
Donald Trump's ear, you were right, I wasn't born here

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.780
just to like, mess with him

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780
I think it's fair to say that, uh, I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.130
will be organizing my post-presidency

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.170
where I'm not close enough to him to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.400
whisper in his ear

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.180
that is very fair.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.439
What would you like your legacy to be? other than not having

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.739
everything be overturned the day after inauguration.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.420
inauguration I feel confident that we

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.829
can build on the progress we've made

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.530
around climate change, clean energy,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.229
healthcare, making the economy work

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.000
better for everybody -- all that feels good

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.979
to me but the thing that I care most

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.020
about is making sure that there's a

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.910
generation of young people who are

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.710
following me and Michelle and if we can look

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.490
back 20 years from now and say to

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.590
ourselves, wow there are a whole bunch of people who

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.690
were inspired by what we did and are

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.510
doing it even better, then we'll feel pretty good

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.460
probably also the first American president

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.710
to be interviewed by Samantha Bee. I''ll

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.240
put you down for that.
(OBAMA) That'll be big.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.949
(SAM) That's huge
(OBAMA) that's gonna have a

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.449
prominent place in our library.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.160
Seeing as how this is our halloween interview, can

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.690
you tell us a spooky story about what

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.610
happens if people don't vote?

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.600
Donald Trump could be president

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.850
ok that was very scary. I'm gonna make it even scarier for you

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.130
Supreme Court Justice Corey Lewandowski

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.039
Speaker of the house Louie Gohmert

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.340
that was pretty scary. I'm not sure I'm

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.510
going to sleep well tonight

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.080
None of us are.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.220
can I lean and give you a big fist bump?

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.069
Absolutely.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.069
Booyah. Pretty exciting.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.310
that was very exciting

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940
We'll be right back
