##

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.730 align:start position:19%
and as you know this is great as you

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.590 align:start position:19%
know we and i do mean we have been

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509 align:start position:19%
trying to get President Obama on the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.429 align:start position:19%
show for a long time and now my dream

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.680 align:start position:19%
was to have him here in the studio with

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570 align:start position:19%
you our studio audience maybe next time

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000 align:start position:19%
for that but the for the interview

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250 align:start position:19%
tonight we were thrilled to be invited

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.120 align:start position:19%
this week to the roosevelt room in the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.800 align:start position:19%
White House with the president

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.750 align:start position:19%
I have to tell you that the president

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.580 align:start position:19%
was extraordinarily generous with this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.670 align:start position:19%
time i wanted to ask him the kind of

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.620 align:start position:19%
questions that we crazy people here at

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.240 align:start position:19%
real-time might be interested in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690 align:start position:19%
kinds of questions he doesn't often get

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.700 align:start position:19%
and two of those we saved to tempt you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.910 align:start position:19%
to see more of the interview online at

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.030 align:start position:19%
youtube.com slash real-time you can see

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.280 align:start position:19%
me ask the president about atheism and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.410 align:start position:19%
about why does America need to have an

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690 align:start position:19%
empire but right now here's the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.809 align:start position:19%
president three days ago at the White

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.660 align:start position:19%
House

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760 align:start position:19%
okay here with the president was very

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.830 align:start position:19%
excited to be here I'm going to be very

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.570 align:start position:19%
grateful thank you very much

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.030 align:start position:19%
you must be little wistful you must be a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.390 align:start position:19%
little like david ortiz about a month

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:19%
ago where you know you're you're going

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:19%
on to great things in the next chapter

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.830 align:start position:19%
of your life start hitting and you're

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.480 align:start position:19%
still heading but my feeder but but you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.770 align:start position:19%
know you'll never quite have a job as

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.240 align:start position:19%
exhilarating

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.910 align:start position:19%
well you know it it is time I tell

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.270 align:start position:19%
people that this has been a great run

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.770 align:start position:19%
I have loved this job I'm not going to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.230 align:start position:19%
pretend that there have been moments of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:19%
great frustration but it is a singular

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.550 align:start position:19%
privilege i am as good a President now

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:19%
as I've ever been because you learned

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.440 align:start position:19%
stuff every eight years you've sort of

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.300 align:start position:19%
been around the track a bunch of times

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:08.039 align:start position:19%
but I also see now the wisdom of the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.209 align:start position:19%
founders that at a certain point you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.310 align:start position:19%
have to let go for the democracy to work

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.330 align:start position:19%
so we're a week out from the election

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:19%
and I you're a history buff I think if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.090 align:start position:19%
when we look back if mr. Trump is

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.370 align:start position:19%
defeated

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.970 align:start position:19%
I'm hopeful that we will be the takeaway

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.310 align:start position:19%
will be that socialism was not such a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:19%
dirty word anymore because of our friend

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:19%
Bernie Sanders and I just wondering

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.660 align:start position:19%
where someone who was accused of the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.819 align:start position:19%
socialist before what do you think about

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.770 align:start position:19%
the idea that in America yes we're

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.800 align:start position:19%
capitalist but some things just should

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.730 align:start position:19%
not be for the profit motive healthcare

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.069 align:start position:19%
prisons the military elections and i

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.540 align:start position:19%
would add news gathering people say get

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:19%
the money out of politics i think you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:19%
gotta get out at the news business first

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.290 align:start position:19%
remember going to learn anything well

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.310 align:start position:19%
couple Prince's first of all in some

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:19%
ways the label socialism doesn't make

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.569 align:start position:19%
that much sense in a context where

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.870 align:start position:19%
there's no economy that doesn't have

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.810 align:start position:19%
some socialist elements meaning that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:19%
there's some common goods that we all

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.930 align:start position:19%
agree

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.660 align:start position:19%
everybody should have that's what social

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.250 align:start position:19%
security is that's what Medicare is to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:19%
some extent that's what public schools

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:19%
are we all chip in to make sure that

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.349 align:start position:19%
everybody no matter the circumstances of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.590 align:start position:19%
your birth have these baseline goods and

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:19%
as you know i felt pretty strongly that

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.549 align:start position:19%
healthcare should be one of those one of

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:19%
those goods

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:19%
I've also said in the past that if I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.380 align:start position:19%
were designing a system from scratch

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.450 align:start position:19%
I would have probably looked at a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.609 align:start position:19%
single-payer system but we do have

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.609 align:start position:19%
legacy systems and and that's the only

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.489 align:start position:19%
thing that sometimes when I've had

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.829 align:start position:19%
conversations with burning I've said to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:19%
him that we don't start from scratch

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.160 align:start position:19%
there there you've got one trillion

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:19%
dollar healthcare industry for example

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:19%
and you get a lot of people who are

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.810 align:start position:19%
working for and a lot of special

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.510 align:start position:19%
interests involved and so my goal in the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:19%
Affordable Care Act was if i can get

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:19%
millions more people insurance then

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.530 align:start position:19%
that's my first goal and then the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:19%
question is how do we make sure

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209 align:start position:19%
everybody ultimately gets it because

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.850 align:start position:19%
there are still gaps in coverage i think

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.870 align:start position:19%
the same is true you know when it comes

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:19%
to some other issues to me I think there

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:19%
is a pretty bright line around prisons i

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.669 align:start position:19%
agree with you that the criminal justice

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.620 align:start position:19%
system should not be affected by that

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:19%
the profit motive that this is the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:19%
awesome power of the state saying we can

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:19%
take somebody's freedom away we can lock

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.150 align:start position:19%
them up because they've reach some

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.710 align:start position:19%
part of the social contract that the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.930 align:start position:19%
notion that you want in you might

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.990 align:start position:19%
incentivize people to lock more people

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.610 align:start position:19%
in or keep them they're longer or not

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.190 align:start position:19%
provide the kind of rehabilitation

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.700 align:start position:19%
services so that they can get out of

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.260 align:start position:19%
there

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:19%
I think that's a problem and so I'm very

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.140 align:start position:19%
proud of some of the work that we've

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.170 align:start position:19%
been trying to do along these lines

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:19%
we've got more work to do when it comes

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:19%
to them the the media that you know

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.260 align:start position:19%
that's a tougher call because look

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.970 align:start position:19%
state-run media that's what they got in

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:19%
no not state-run but just like it used

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:19%
to be where it was a loss leader for

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.260 align:start position:19%
that for the network's they didn't have

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.330 align:start position:19%
to make up a profit community is funny

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.580 align:start position:19%
because they had a monopoly though to

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.530 align:start position:19%
some degree right right so they were fat

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.630 align:start position:19%
and happy in this kind of environment

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:42.090 align:start position:19%
it's hard to figure out how you would do

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:19%
that but you know the I think the

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.590 align:start position:19%
question I'd have when it comes to the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:54.390 align:start position:19%
media is how do we create a space where

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.110 align:start position:19%
truth gets eyeballs and his entertaining

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.690 align:start position:19%
and we can build a common conversation

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.890 align:start position:19%
at a what is true when i leave here one

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:19%
of the things I'm most concerned about

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:08.760 align:start position:19%
is the balkanization of the media where

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.090 align:start position:19%
you've got 800 stations you got all

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.710 align:start position:19%
these websites people have difficulty

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.370 align:start position:19%
now just sorting out what's true and

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.980 align:start position:19%
what's not

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.920 align:start position:19%
yeah and if you don't have some common

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:19%
baseline effects do you eat we can have

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.770 align:start position:19%
a disagreement about how to deal with

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:19%
climate change but if we have a big

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.970 align:start position:19%
chunk of the country that share just

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:19%
discounts what 99% of scientists a

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:19%
completely it's very hard to figure out

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:19%
how we move the democracy forward

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:19%
okay let me ask you about a question

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:19%
that I know people who watch our show

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.130 align:start position:19%
were interested in churches marijuana

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:19%
reform is that something that you care

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.190 align:start position:19%
about

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.060 align:start position:19%
I did something like they're backwards

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.860 align:start position:19%
now we both made jokes about it but it's

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.200 align:start position:19%
not funny to the people who get arrested

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.370 align:start position:19%
which is over half a million i think

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:19%
last year it you know you and I both

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.990 align:start position:19%
could have had our lives ruined not

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.170 align:start position:19%
really by smoking it but by being

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:19%
arrested for it right and you know I

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.530 align:start position:19%
feel like you had a checklist about

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.500 align:start position:19%
let's get rid of a lot of the stupid

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.660 align:start position:19%
stuff like opening up Cuba you know you

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.790 align:start position:19%
came out for gay marriage

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.040 align:start position:19%
I was hoping ending the drug world would

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.020 align:start position:19%
be on that list is on the ballot now in

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.690 align:start position:19%
nine states in a week including

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:19%
California for recreational and Arizona

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:29.300 align:start position:19%
and medical in places like North Dakota

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.150 align:start position:19%
isn't time the federal government caught

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.860 align:start position:19%
up to progressive states like Arizona

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.300 align:start position:19%
and North Dakota

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:44.660 align:start position:19%
well here's what I mean I have always

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:48.620 align:start position:19%
believed that to the extent that the

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.980 align:start position:19%
society legitimately wants to guard

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.480 align:start position:19%
against any kind of substance abuse that

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:19%
you treated as a public health problem

00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:02.630 align:start position:19%
look I'm an ex-smoker cigarette smoker

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:04.100 align:start position:19%
x.x and really yeah i really did you get

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.020 align:start position:19%
that many ride their heights

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:10.910 align:start position:19%
I thought I got away I i'm sure the heck

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.890 align:start position:19%
out of Nicorette really

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:16.430 align:start position:19%
but you know what I when I pass

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:20.750 align:start position:19%
healthcare reform that would I think

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:23.660 align:start position:19%
right I'd had my last cigarette butt but

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:26.180 align:start position:19%
the reason is because there was this

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:31.490 align:start position:19%
enormous public health effort to get

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:19%
kids not to pick up smoking and to make

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.979 align:start position:19%
sure that parents felt guilty if if they

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.130 align:start position:19%
were passing on that that have it to

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:44.660 align:start position:19%
their kids and I've and so that's where

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:49.340 align:start position:19%
I think we need to go with pot alcohol

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:52.280 align:start position:19%
and so so I don't think that

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:19%
legalization is a panacea but i think

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:19%
that we're gonna have to have a more

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.230 align:start position:19%
serious conversation about how we are

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.420 align:start position:19%
treating marijuana and our drug laws

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.190 align:start position:19%
generally ok i want to ask you this

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.810 align:start position:19%
question again it's an issue i think you

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.310 align:start position:19%
don't get asked a lot about but it's

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.470 align:start position:19%
important to my audience and I know

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.260 align:start position:19%
people will roll their eyes and say so

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.330 align:start position:19%
California to ask this but food purity

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.210 align:start position:19%
yeah something that means a lot to me

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.850 align:start position:19%
somehow it got to be elitist or liberal

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.740 align:start position:19%
I don't get that to want food that isn't

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:19%
full of pesticides food that wasn't

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.930 align:start position:19%
created by torturing animals at in

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.960 align:start position:19%
factory farms is in full of antibiotics

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:32.900 align:start position:19%
which is a problem in itself

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.150 align:start position:19%
I feel like we're upside down on food we

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.370 align:start position:19%
eat too much corn because we grow too

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:19%
much corn because we subsidize too much

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:19%
corn and you know one of the problems

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.140 align:start position:19%
with the Affordable Care Act is that

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.900 align:start position:19%
people were found to sikkre right then

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:50.510 align:start position:19%
expected right and that's partly versus

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:19%
the food i think an intensity and all of

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.100 align:start position:19%
work that Michelle's been doing yeah

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:19%
that was written the food be put more at

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:19%
the top of the end when when we come to

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.470 align:start position:19%
addressing health care

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.060 align:start position:19%
there's no doubt about it that right now

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.500 align:start position:19%
we got a disease care system we should

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.630 align:start position:19%
have a healthcare system and healthcare

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:19%
system would include nutrition exercise

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:19%
but also pushing back on corporal and

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.330 align:start position:19%
and so angry I i think what is true is

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.850 align:start position:19%
that for a long time

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:21.550 align:start position:19%
agribusiness has a day obviously a

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:25.570 align:start position:19%
prominent seat at the table in common

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:28.330 align:start position:19%
it's bipartisan some of the reforms that

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:19%
we've tried to initiate for example on

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.950 align:start position:19%
the school lunch program had actually

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.510 align:start position:19%
made some progress on this front and

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.180 align:start position:19%
Michelle deserves a lot of credit for it

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:40.570 align:start position:19%
as do a bunch of organizations that have

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.430 align:start position:19%
worked on this i will tell you and this

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.149 align:start position:19%
may be controversial and in some of your

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:19%
audience

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:47.950 align:start position:19%
it is important to look at the science

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:19%
on this stuff so when it comes to

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.990 align:start position:19%
antibiotics for example the science is

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:55.420 align:start position:19%
clear we pump our animals full of it and

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:58.630 align:start position:19%
and that's not just a problem in terms

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:02.740 align:start position:19%
of what we're in ingesting it's also

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:04.779 align:start position:19%
problem that more and more you know

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:10.029 align:start position:19%
bacteria is becoming resistant resistant

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:19%
to antibiotics but in some cases like

00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:15.790 align:start position:19%
for example the GMO debate it there are

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.850 align:start position:19%
there areas where there are legitimate

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:21.370 align:start position:19%
concerns there are some areas where the

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:19%
science seems to indicate well this is

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:19%
ok we hand out back to the signs that

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.459 align:start position:19%
says it doesn't increase the year while

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.250 align:start position:19%
exactly and they use just as many if not

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:32.230 align:start position:19%
more perspective well that's so so my

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.630 align:start position:19%
point is what that what we have to be

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.149 align:start position:19%
make sure we're doing whether on the

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:40.990 align:start position:19%
left or the right is being driven by the

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:45.459 align:start position:19%
science and if it turns out that some of

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:49.779 align:start position:19%
these genetically modified foods aren't

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:53.110 align:start position:19%
healthier aren't more productive and use

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:55.990 align:start position:19%
more pesticides then we should follow

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.310 align:start position:19%
the science if in some cases they're not

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.050 align:start position:19%
causing any harm

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:19%
then we should follow the signs there as

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.899 align:start position:19%
well you think we asked too little of

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:19%
the public and politicians you know of

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:08.350 align:start position:19%
course are always kissing up to the

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.970 align:start position:19%
public and saying things like if we only

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:19%
had a government as good as the people

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.500 align:start position:19%
but the people aren't very well-informed

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.420 align:start position:19%
they don't exercise their right to vote

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.779 align:start position:19%
and when they do they don't know much

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.579 align:start position:19%
about it I just feel like we don't we

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:23.860 align:start position:19%
don't ask the people very much were

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:26.170 align:start position:19%
afraid to ask the people eat better you

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.370 align:start position:19%
know that the phrase was yes we can and

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.230 align:start position:19%
I feel like they're not pulling their

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.329 align:start position:19%
weight on the weeds a partnership with

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:35.319 align:start position:19%
you eat better vote more

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:39.009 align:start position:19%
something I i I'm a glass half full guy

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:41.769 align:start position:19%
and an optimist about the human spirit

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:44.350 align:start position:19%
you are right though that people are

00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:46.089 align:start position:19%
busy they're stressed and they don't

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.910 align:start position:19%
have time to follow the intricacies of

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:53.709 align:start position:19%
some debate around Medicaid or what's

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:19%
going on in Syria and so part of the but

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:58.929 align:start position:19%
when i say i wanted government as good

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.989 align:start position:19%
as the the American people what i mean

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:06.879 align:start position:19%
by that is that i think people's

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:09.309 align:start position:19%
instincts and their gut what that what

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:11.139 align:start position:19%
they what they want out of life and how

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:14.980 align:start position:19%
they want to see people treated is

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:16.660 align:start position:19%
actually pretty good but the question

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:20.230 align:start position:19%
then becomes how do we get enough

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.970 align:start position:19%
information in front of them to be able

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.610 align:start position:19%
to make good decisions i I've always

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.379 align:start position:19%
believed that if i could get into you

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.110 align:start position:19%
know if I could sit in the living room

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:32.739 align:start position:19%
whatever person in America over that

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:34.329 align:start position:19%
I've got the majority on my side and a

00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:36.669 align:start position:19%
healthy majority on my side on every

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:19%
issue that we work on just by having a

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:41.230 align:start position:19%
conversation the problem is we got all

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:19%
these filters and look at my watch fox

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:19%
news i wouldn't vote for me either

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:47.829 align:start position:19%
right because you know you got this

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.419 align:start position:19%
screen this fun house mirror through

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:53.709 align:start position:19%
which people are receiving information

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:55.389 align:start position:19%
how did how to break through that is a

00:13:53.709 --> 00:14:01.299 align:start position:19%
big challenge that this whole

00:13:55.389 --> 00:14:03.069 align:start position:19%
conversation that's been had lately in

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:08.259 align:start position:19%
in the aftermath of the rise of Trump

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:11.499 align:start position:19%
this notion that part of what's happened

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:13.119 align:start position:19%
is that both Republican and Democratic

00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:15.610 align:start position:19%
elites have neglected the white

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:19.569 align:start position:19%
working-class men truth of the matter is

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:21.339 align:start position:19%
is that every policy i put forward would

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:23.290 align:start position:19%
make a huge difference with white

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:19%
working class and the black working

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.499 align:start position:19%
class and the Latino working class

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:28.929 align:start position:19%
whether it's raising the minimum wage or

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:30.129 align:start position:19%
the Affordable Care Act given people

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:33.429 align:start position:19%
health care who don't have it and you're

00:14:30.129 --> 00:14:36.910 align:start position:19%
working hard and and need help or making

00:14:33.429 --> 00:14:39.549 align:start position:19%
sure that unions are our strong so that

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:19%
you can have a little more leverage at

00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:44.130 align:start position:19%
the workplace or making sure that

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.700 align:start position:19%
you know something like for consumer

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:19%
finance Protection Bureau is is made is

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:19%
protecting against some scam mortgage

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.630 align:start position:19%
and what I'd like to figure out and i

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.150 align:start position:19%
think democrats do have an affirmative

00:14:54.630 --> 00:15:04.530 align:start position:19%
obligation to do that do this is is to

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:06.090 align:start position:19%
work harder to to to to figure out in in

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.470 align:start position:19%
this new age

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.030 align:start position:19%
what's the equivalent of getting into

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:19%
people's living rooms and being able to

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:19%
have a conversation and being able to

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.700 align:start position:19%
