WE'RE HERE WITH FIRST LADY
MICHELLE OBAMA.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.740 align:start position:0%
THE CAMPAIGN IS GOING ON RIGHT
NOW.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.910
WE'VE GOT THE TWO CANDIDATES OUT
THERE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDAS

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.747
AND THEIR SPOUSES HAVE TO SORT
OF GO ALONG WITH WHATEVER THIS

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.481 align:start position:0%
PERSON IS DOING.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.450
DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO THERE AND

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.753 align:start position:0%
STAND BY THE PERSON RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:23.089 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO?

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.194 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, BECAUSE IF-- YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, IN IT.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:32.065 size:88% position:44%
IF YOU'RE IN IT, AND IF YOU
DON'T AGREE, YOU SHOULD HAVE

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
AGREED BEFORE THEY RAN, YOU
KNOW.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.269
BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU DIDN'T
AGREE WITH WHAT BARACK WAS

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start position:0%
SAYING, I WOULD NOT SUPPORT HIS
RUN.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.344
SO I STAND THERE PROUDLY, AND I
HOPE THEY ARE, TOO, STANDING

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.013 size:84% position:42%
WITH THEIR SPOUSES PROUDLY.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.681 align:start position:0%
SO NO SYMPATHY.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.018 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT THE THINGS
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:56.189
FOR INSTANCE, MELANIA TRUMP WAS
CRITICIZED FOR USING WHAT TURNED

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.025 align:start position:0%
OUT TO BE A PORTION OF YOUR
SPEECH.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.260 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.895 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND
HER CREATING THINGS.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.164 align:start position:0%
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME
SYMPATHY FOR HER.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.834
COW UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT BE
SYMPATHETIC FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:08.368 align:start position:0%
HER?

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start position:0%
YEAH, THAT WAS TOUGH.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:14.441 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.842 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start position:0%
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.210 align:start position:0%
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.646 align:start position:0%
LET'S TALK ABOUT "LET GIRLS
LEARN."

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:24.017
SO 62 MILLION YOUNG WOMEN AROUND
THE WORLD DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:24.951 align:start position:0%
QUALITY EDUCATION.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:29.355 align:start position:0%
WHAT IS "LET GIRLS LEARN" DOING
TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:29.622 align:start position:0%
SITUATION?

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.723
BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.458 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S HUGE.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start position:0%
PART OF IT IS BRINGING AWARENESS
TO THE ISSUE.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:38.098 align:start position:0%
NOT JUST INTERNATIONALLY, BUT
HERE AT HOME AS WELL.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0%
AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN A YEAR
AND A HALF TO GALVANIZE

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:46.339 align:start position:0%
RESOURCES, EXPERTISE.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start position:0%
UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED
MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCE.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:53.346
WE'VE PARTNERED WITH JAPAN AND
THE U.K. TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.315 align:start position:0%
IN GIRLS' EDUCATION.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:02:00.920
THE THE THE WORLD BANK GROUP IS
INVESTING OVER $1 BILLION IN

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.721 align:start position:0%
GIRLS' EDUCATION.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.589 align:start position:0%
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:06.025 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SOME OF THESE--
SOME OF THE REASONS-- I ASSUME--

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.928
AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M
WRONG-- I ASSUME SOME OF THE

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:12.165
REASONS ARE THERE ARE SORT OF
CULTURAL OBSTACLES TO GIRLS

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.735 align:start position:0%
BEING VALUED AS EDUCATED MEMBERS
OF SOCIETY.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:19.172 align:start position:0%
HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU
EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THOSE

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.208
CULTURAL OBSTACLES, RATHER THAN
JUST PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY, HOW

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start position:0%
DO YOU MAKE SURE THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES ARE TAKEN

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.514
ADVANTAGE OF IN COUNTRIES THAT
MAY NOT ORDINARILY OFFER THEM?

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.517
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.485 align:start position:0%
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BE ON THE
GROUND.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.155 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHANGE CULTURE
IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:35.388 align:start position:0%
CULTURE.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.224 align:start position:0%
AND THE PEACE CORPS HAS PLAYED
AN IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:43.963
WE HAVE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS
WORKING ON "LET GIRLS LEARN"

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:47.534
INITIATIVES ON THE GROUND, IN A
COMMUNITY, IN A VILLAGE, FOR UP

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.904 align:start position:0%
TO TO TO YEARS, REALLY
UNDERSTANDING THE CULTURAL

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.673
ISSUES, DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP
TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR NOT JUST

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.175 size:88% position:44%
THE GIRLS BUT THEIR PARENTS.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.011 size:78% position:39%
SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE EACH
COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.913
THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION TO THAT.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:04.350 align:start position:0%
THIS PROBLEM, WHICH IS WHAT
MAKES IT SO COMPLICATED-- EVERY

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.152 align:start position:0%
COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:09.622 align:start position:0%
SO AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT IS
CRITICAL.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:14.527
BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE PEACE
CORPS VOLUNTEERS OUT THERE DOING

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.696 size:88% position:44%
THE HARD WORK ON THE GROUND.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I UNDERSTAND,
RIGHT HERE IN THE AUDIENCE--

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.867
AND, JIM, IF WE COULD GET A SHOT
OF THIS-- THERE ARE SOME YOUNG

LADIES IN THE FRONT ROW HERE.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.102 align:start position:0%

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.989 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY-- THEY SPOKE SO
ELOQUENTLY.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.559
THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES AT AN

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.926 align:start position:0%

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.796 align:start position:0%

TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.536
WE HELD IT FOR THE SPOUSES OF

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.070 align:start position:0%
GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.809
IT WAS A MIXTURE OF STORIES AND,

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.379
GIRLS, AND EMPOWERING MUSIC FROM
SOME OF THE TOP BROADWAY STARS.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.149

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.292
YOU DON'T JUST MAKE US LAUGH.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:22.595 align:start position:0%
