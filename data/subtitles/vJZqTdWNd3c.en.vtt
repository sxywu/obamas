00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.537 align:start size:75% position:25% line:85%
We like having you here.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.537
It is great to see everybody.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.239
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.341 size:66% position:67%
This is history here,
because it's --

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.510 align:end position:100%
"The Tonight Show's" been
in New York for years,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.712 size:78% position:61%
but it's never had
a sitting president here.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.514 align:end position:100%
So this is the first time
a sitting president...

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.716 align:start size:97% position:3% line:85%
Interesting.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.716 align:start size:59% position:41%
...is sitting here.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.217
[ Laughter ]

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.786 size:63% position:31%
My advance people
didn't tell me that.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:20.820 align:start size:44% position:56%
Exactly.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.054 size:66% position:33%
I'm not sure
I would have done it.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.857 align:start position:0%
I mean, is there a reason
why other guys didn't do it?

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.492 align:start size:56% position:44%
No, yes, no, no.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.261 size:59% position:70%
No, there hasn't --
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.830 align:end position:100% line:91%
This is the final eight months
of your presidency.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.531 size:66% position:67%
Are you getting
a little sentimental?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.766 size:59% position:70%
You getting
a little weepy?

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.734 align:start size:72% position:28%
No.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.735 align:start size:44% position:56% line:92%
Come on.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.735 align:start size:81% position:19%
No.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.407 size:75% position:38%
No, look,
this year's really busy.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.942 size:66% position:33%
Just like last year
was busy.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.411
I keep on thinking,
"All right, at a certain point,

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.146 align:start size:94% position:6%
things are gonna
kind of ease up."

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.147 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they haven't.

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.882 size:63% position:31%
And we've gotten
a lot of stuff done.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.484 size:88% position:44%
You know, I had a Cuba trip.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.187
I just came back from Vietnam,
Hiroshima.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:59.225 size:66% position:33%
And so the work
keeps you occupied.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
Every once in a while,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start position:0%
you start thinking about
the people you've worked with.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:08.401
And that's where you start
getting a little sentimental.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.069 size:88% position:44%
But you try to fight it off,

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to
be crying in the Oval Office.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:17.343
It's a downer, and then people
would think, "My God," you know.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.911
[ Laughter ]

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.682 align:start size:81% position:19% line:78%
How can you be our leader?

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.682 size:72% position:36%
If they see
the president crying...

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.184 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
Every day.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.184
...then it could be a problem.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.485 align:start size:59% position:41%
Could be a problem.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.955 size:66% position:33%
So, I try
to screen it out.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start size:72% position:28%
When is the last day --

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.825 align:end position:100%
Like, when do they say you
got to have your bags packed

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.461 size:63% position:69%
and you gotta
get out of here?

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.097 align:start size:97% position:3%
Uh...I don't know.
I should find out.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.432
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.268 size:69% position:34%
No.
It's actually amazing,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:47.606 align:start position:0%
because they literally move
all your stuff out in one day.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start position:0%
You are living there.
And then suddenly --

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.946 size:63% position:31%
It's not all out
on the south lawn.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.381 size:75% position:38%
I mean, they pack it up.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.649 align:start position:0%
But they will move it

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.285 size:88% position:44%
to wherever it is
that you want to move it to.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.954 size:63% position:31%
And so you're living
in the White House

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.889 size:81% position:41%
up until Inauguration Day.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.958 size:63% position:31%
Inauguration Day,
you're out of there.

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.326
And I read on the Internet --

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.561 align:end position:100%
I don't know -- I believe
everything on the Internet.

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.698 size:75% position:63%
And I read that you guys
are moving --

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.968
you guys are moving, like, two
miles away from the White House.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.003 size:63% position:31%
We will be staying
in D.C.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:21.040 size:84% position:42%
because my younger daughter
will still be in school,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.510 size:84% position:42%
and the idea of her
having to transfer schools,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.946 size:84% position:42%
move to a new city
halfway through high school

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.783 size:81% position:41%
would not make me popular.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:31.751 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:32.852
[ Laughter ]

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.020 size:75% position:63%
I thought you were
just being like that kid

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.754 align:end position:100%
that graduated high school
and just never left.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:37.523 size:59% position:70%
Like, "Hey, guys,
how you doing?"

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.491 size:81% position:41%
I mean,
it is a little depressing.

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:40.627 align:start position:0%
If you're kind of --

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.028 align:start position:0%
You're like the old guy
at the disco, right?

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.196 align:start size:91% position:9%
I'm still here.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:47.299 size:88% position:56%
Having a kegger
on the east lawn, everybody.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.535 size:69% position:66%
"All right, all right,
all right."

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:53.740 align:start size:66% position:34%
"No, you gotta leave.
You have to go, sir."

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.008 align:start size:97% position:3%
People whispering.
"He's still here."

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.112 align:end position:100%
"What do we say to him?
Somebody talk to him."
