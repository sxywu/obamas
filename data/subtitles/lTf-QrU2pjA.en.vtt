00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.490
Right now it's time to play a brand
new game called Oops, My Water Broke.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.869
All right Stephen,
you're gonna sit down and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:10.340
we're gonna take turns pulling out these
pins and one or two balloons may fall.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.530
The person who pulls the pin that makes
all the balloons drop is the loser.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.100
&gt;&gt; It depends on how you look at it.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.060
&gt;&gt; So Stephen,
you're gonna get very, very wet.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.725
&gt;&gt; All right.
Let's do it, let's do it.

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:21.880
&gt;&gt; Sit right there.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.819
We go up here.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.130
We don't know which pin is gonna, do you
wanna start or do you want me to start?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.510
&gt;&gt; I think I'll start.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.200
I think.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.800
&gt;&gt; Take your time.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.898
Take your time.

00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:37.552
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:43.790
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.410
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.310
This is sticky.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.806
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.660
&gt;&gt; No.
I don't know.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.700
&gt;&gt; I don't like the sound of that.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.910
It drips!
&gt;&gt; That's water drops.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.710
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.379
But one balloon don't count, the loser's
the one who does all the balloons.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:14.980
&gt;&gt; This is definitely gonna be one.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.670
&gt;&gt; That's definitely gonna be one.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.854
Stephen!
&gt;&gt; Aah!

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:24.085
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sorry, babe.

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.850
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; I still love you.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.918
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:29.294
&gt;&gt; Whoo!

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:35.617
&gt;&gt; That wasn't a good one.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.424
&gt;&gt; That wasn't a good one, either.

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.390
&gt;&gt; I'm just-
&gt;&gt; It's really a slow burn.

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:42.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I think we're running out of options.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.060
&gt;&gt; Is it the fright?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.025
It would be better if you-
&gt;&gt; Don't do it now, let's just go.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:46.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah okay.
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:49.866
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:54.141
[LAUGH]

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:54.666
&gt;&gt; I have a feeling.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.030
&gt;&gt; You think long, you think wrong Ellen.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.626
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; It's the old saying.

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:04.230
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.964
&gt;&gt; There's way too many
balloons in that basket.

00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:13.282
&gt;&gt; They should be just worked out or
something.

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:20.333
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:25.271
&gt;&gt; Man.

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:28.648
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; What a good sport!

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.468
&gt;&gt; That's how we play,
oops my water broke.

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:31.082
We'll be right back.
