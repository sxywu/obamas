00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.480
I COULD BE A

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.780
POLITICIAN LIKE THAT --
(SNAP)

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.300
-- BUT A POLITICIAN COULD NEVER
DO MY JOB, WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.380
SHOULD LISTEN TO MY CURE FOR
ObamaCare, AND THAT BRINGS

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:25.559
US TO TONIGHT'S --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.228
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:29.029
THANK YOU.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.899
THANK YOU.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.467
STEPHEN.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.903
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PRESIDENT OBAMA I
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE OUT HERE

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:42.509
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH!

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:46.180
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PRESIDENT OBAMA, I'M THRILLED

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:50.284
YOU'RE HERE BUT I DID NOT EXPECT
YOU FOR ANOTHER THREE MINUTES.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:54.454
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN, YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING
A LOT OF SHOTS AT MY JOB.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:01:01.895
I DECIDED I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE A SHOT AT YOURS.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.431
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF THE WAY

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.432
WHAT PART OF THE SEGMENT ARE WE
IN NOW?

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.367
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO BE DOING?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:18.712
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WAS ABOUT TO DO
"THE WORD," SIR.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.380
&gt;&gt; "THE WORD."

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:25.819
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOW HARD CAN THIS BE?

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.889
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY WHATEVER
YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.526
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKEY-DOKE.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.627
OKAY.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:45.739
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION -- NATION, INSTEAD OF THE

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:51.144
WORD, LET'S MAKE THIS A LITTLE
MORE PRESIDENTIAL,

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:52.980
WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
"DECREE"...

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:57.217
(PLAYING "HAIL TO THE CHIEF,"
THEN CLANG)

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.920
... TO HEALTH IN A HAND BASKET.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:05.893
NATION, AS YOU KNOW, I, STEPHEN
COLBERT, HAVE NEVER CARED FOR

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.428
OUR PRESIDENT.

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:13.033
(LAUGHTER)
THE GUY IS SO ARROGANT, I BET HE

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.536
TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF IN THE THIRD
PERSON.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:29.917
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.485
BUT EVEN I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
ObamaCare IS THE LAW OF THE

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:37.391
LAND.

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:41.461
AND WHILE IT'S BEEN POLITICALLY
DIVISIVE, THERE ARE THINGS THAT

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:46.400
PEOPLE FROM BOTH PARTIES LIKE
ABOUT ObamaCare.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.070
(LAUGHTER)
FOR INSTANCE, THAT CHILDREN CAN

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.974
STAY ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICIES
UNTIL AGE 26.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:03:03.884
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NEARLY 7 MILLION PEOPLE SIGNED

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.653
UP LAST YEAR AND ALMOST
1 MILLION MORE HAVE SIGNED UP IN

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.957
JUST THE PAST FEW WEEKS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.930
NOW, NATION THE QUESTION IS HOW
DO YOU STOP SOMETHING

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:21.368
THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
STARTING TO LIKE?

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:28.842
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:32.346
WELL, FIRST OFF, NOW THAT THE
REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH THE

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.248
HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THEY COULD
PASS A BILL REPEALING

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.683
ObamaCare.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:41.088
BUT THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS THE
VETO.

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:44.992
AND IF I KNOW THAT GUY, HE'S
WILLING TO USE IT.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:57.604
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND LET'S FACE IT. EVEN IF

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.139
REPUBLICANS SOMEHOW DID REPEAL
IT, THEY'D HAVE TO REPLACE IT

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.843
WITH THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE PLAN.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.646
(LAUGHTER)
AND ONCE THEY TOUCH IT, THEY OWN

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:10.450
IT.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.453
THEN IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WILL BE

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:21.461
COMPLAINING ABOUT MITCH
McCONNELL-CARE.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:28.101
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE, ANOTHER STRATEGY IS

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:30.204
TAKING ObamaCare TO THE
SUPREME COURT AND TRYING TO GET

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.040
IT THROWN OUT.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:39.913
BUT LAST TIME WE TRIED THAT, IT
DIDN'T WORK.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:48.255
I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE
FIRE WAY TO KILL THIS THING.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:54.995
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.763
WE HAVE TO MAKE SIGNING UP FOR
ObamaCare UNAPPEALING TO

00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:02.536
YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:08.809
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.345
WE CAN SCARE THEM AWAY BY
REMINDING THEM THAT LAST YEAR'S

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:16.316
WEB SITE ROLLOUT WAS A LITTLE
BUMPY.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.620
(LAUGHTER)
REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.322
HEALTHCARE.GOV WEB SITE?

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.392
I THINK THAT'S WHERE DISNEY GOT
THE IDEA FOR "FROZEN."

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:36.403
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, THE NEW WEB SITE WORKS, AND

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.239
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET
COVERED FOR LESS THAN $100.

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:43.410
BUT HOW'S THE PRESIDENT GOING TO
GET THAT MESSAGE OUT TO THE

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:51.218
KIDS?

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.055
(APPLAUSE)
HE COULD TRY TO APPEAL TO THEM

00:05:55.088 --> 00:06:00.093
DIRECTLY THROUGH A SPEECH OR A
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT YOUNG

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:04.331
PEOPLE DON'T WATCH REAL NEWS
SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:14.374
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THEY WATCH COMEDY SHOWS, AND I

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:19.513
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THEY WATCH COMEDY SHOWS, AND I

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.249
JUST DON'T SEE THE PRESIDENT
GOING ON ONE OF THOSE.

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:29.690
THEY'RE BENEATH HIS DIGNITY.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:39.233
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BESIDES, EVEN IF HE DID GET HIS

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:40.968
MESSAGE ACROSS, YOUNG PEOPLE
DON'T THINK THEY NEED ANY

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:42.035
INSURANCE.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.339
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE YOUNG!

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:50.511
THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT EVERYONE
EVENTUALLY GROWS OLDER...

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:54.615
AT SOMETIMES A FASTER RATE
THAN OTHERS.

00:06:54.648 --> 00:07:01.221
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.890
AND THAT'S THE DECREE.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.926
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE
LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.
