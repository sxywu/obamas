00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279 align:start position:19%
there's American need to be an empire we

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.400 align:start position:19%
have more troops in more places than any

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.290 align:start position:19%
Empire in the history of the world we

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880 align:start position:19%
spent over six hundred billion on

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.460 align:start position:19%
defense and that's not including the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.870 align:start position:19%
nukes taking care of veterans homeland

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970 align:start position:19%
security when you add it all up it's

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.650 align:start position:19%
probably over a trillion to keep the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.560 align:start position:19%
monsters away i'm wondering if we could

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.130 align:start position:19%
be just to save spending half as much

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.840 align:start position:19%
eisenhower warned when he was close to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:19%
the end of his second term like you are

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550 align:start position:19%
now about the military-industrial

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.100 align:start position:19%
complex and it seems no president of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379 align:start position:19%
either party ever makes any progress on

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390 align:start position:19%
that pushing back on that whatever

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.770 align:start position:19%
happened did you want to do that well

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.090 align:start position:19%
look I had keep in mind billet when i

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.129 align:start position:19%
came into office we had a hundred eighty

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.180 align:start position:19%
thousand troops just in Iraq and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:19%
Afghanistan now we probably have about

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.510 align:start position:19%
15,000 so that that's pretty big

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.360 align:start position:19%
we still spend a bunch of folks still

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.670 align:start position:19%
spend morale you know actually are

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:18.450 align:start position:19%
spending I think his has been steady e

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:22.770 align:start position:19%
here's what I'd say that humility and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.670 align:start position:19%
foreign policy is is a useful trait

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.829 align:start position:19%
particularly in the Oval Office think

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.740 align:start position:19%
bad things happen around the world and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.460 align:start position:19%
our natural instinct is we should do

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.299 align:start position:19%
something there are times where our

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.110 align:start position:19%
intervention makes a difference but

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.510 align:start position:19%
there are a lot of times where

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:53.690 align:start position:19%
the unintended consequences can result

00:01:47.510 --> 00:02:00.470 align:start position:19%
in more problems when we intervene and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:02.690 align:start position:19%
sorting out where those where those

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.040 align:start position:19%
issues play out is I think one of the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:11.330 align:start position:19%
biggest challenges that any president

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:13.790 align:start position:19%
has my bias is that if it comes to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:19%
defending the American people against

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:19%
al-qaeda ISIL somebody wants to blow up

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.920 align:start position:19%
a train station in midtown Manhattan

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:19%
that I'm gonna go after them and I make

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.360 align:start position:19%
no apologies about it and I want a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.550 align:start position:19%
vigorous military in place and when it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070 align:start position:19%
comes to maintaining a basic

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.060 align:start position:19%
international order so that a guy like

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.739 align:start position:19%
kim jongmin in North Korea doesn't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050 align:start position:19%
suddenly start holding all of Asia

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.000 align:start position:19%
hostage because he is building a bunch

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.489 align:start position:19%
of nuclear weapons and and feels free to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.680 align:start position:19%
threaten everybody else it's important

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.630 align:start position:19%
for us to have alliances in place and to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.810 align:start position:19%
be able to work on the international

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.570 align:start position:19%
scene and us having the most powerful

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.790 align:start position:19%
military on earth helps that happen

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:19%
it helps check the impulses of some

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.470 align:start position:19%
other bad folks and and i will tell you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.970 align:start position:19%
as somebody who has now served as

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.090 align:start position:19%
commander in chief for the last eight

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.390 align:start position:19%
years not only are the men and women in

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:19%
uniform that I work with extraordinary

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.850 align:start position:19%
you know you meet 23 year olds who are

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:19%
in charge of life and death missions and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.370 align:start position:19%
maintaining billion-dollar pieces of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.610 align:start position:19%
equipment and they just execute and do

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.989 align:start position:19%
it unbelievably well but what you also

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.780 align:start position:19%
discover is my top brass Joint Chiefs of

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.450 align:start position:19%
Staff they're not the chickenhawks who

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:19%
are going around trying to get us into

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.230 align:start position:19%
every single War I

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.490 align:start position:19%
you know the the generals the Colonel's

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.730 align:start position:19%
that the commander's that I work with

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.080 align:start position:19%
they know that the wages of war and

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.450 align:start position:19%
they're actually pretty thoughtful about

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.220 align:start position:19%
it and typically in the Situation Room

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.800 align:start position:19%
they're the ones who are like well

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.600 align:start position:19%
before we go half-cocked on something

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.520 align:start position:19%
let's really think about this because

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.510 align:start position:19%
this is what would be involved and they

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.880 align:start position:19%
have seen what's what's involved because

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.790 align:start position:19%
most of them are people who were

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.470 align:start position:19%
fighting in Iraq and fighting in

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.330 align:start position:19%
Afghanistan and they know how hard these

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.950 align:start position:19%
environments are and and that no matter

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.770 align:start position:19%
how good our intentions a lot of times

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.030 align:start position:19%
it can go haywire

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.410 align:start position:19%
but having said all that I think we

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.480 align:start position:19%
should ever strength i think we should

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.480 align:start position:19%
have humility I think we have to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:19%
wherever possible work multilaterally

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:19%
and not just unilaterally because if we

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:19%
can't organize coalition's to do things

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.580 align:start position:19%
that means that maybe weren't we haven't

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:19%
thought everything through having said

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:19%
all that it turns out did is as flawed

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:19%
as sometimes our foreign policy can be

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:19%
or whatever blind spots we have we

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:19%
really are the indispensable nation if

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:14.070 align:start position:19%
we if there is a typhoon that wipes out

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.350 align:start position:19%
someplace in Southeast Asia our military

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.090 align:start position:19%
is the only organization that has the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.390 align:start position:19%
infrastructure to help those folks

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.110 align:start position:19%
quickly when a bola came out we actually

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.090 align:start position:19%
had to build the platform whereby

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.020 align:start position:19%
everybody else could even think about

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.970 align:start position:19%
bringing their doctors and nurses and if

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:40.770 align:start position:19%
you have a rogue nation that decided it

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:19%
was going to you know take action that

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:19%
that significantly threatened

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:55.250 align:start position:19%
a lot of people I'd want to know that

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.570 align:start position:19%
the US military was there and so and and

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:19%
i can tell you setting aside our

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.320 align:start position:19%
military power there's not an

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:19%
international meeting i go to in which

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.140 align:start position:19%
if we weren't sitting at the table

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:19%
nothing to get done because for the most

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:19%
part other countries don't have either

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.770 align:start position:19%
the capacity or the inclination and when

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:19%
you've got a bunch of authoritarian

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.200 align:start position:19%
governments out there and at creeping

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:19%
authoritarianism pulse around the world

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:32.990 align:start position:19%
we also are the ones who are pushing

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:35.330 align:start position:19%
back most effectively in perfectly but

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.480 align:start position:19%
most effectively against locking up

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.270 align:start position:19%
journalists and killing human rights

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.940 align:start position:19%
activists and making sure that poor

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:50.480 align:start position:19%
people get food and dealing with public

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:56.780 align:start position:19%
health crises I think it if you see the

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.260 align:start position:19%
world from my seat I won't sort of as

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:19%
bad

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.350 align:start position:19%
assorted that the one thing I think is

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:13.640 align:start position:19%
important for progressives to guard

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:17.710 align:start position:19%
against is a tendency sometimes to not

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.870 align:start position:19%
fully appreciate

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.980 align:start position:19%
yeah that up that America has bad guys

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.050 align:start position:19%
and that Americans are pretty it is not

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.050 align:start position:19%
just a great nation in the sense that

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:34.810 align:start position:19%
it's powerful but that our values night

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:37.780 align:start position:19%
rnr ideals actually matter and we do a

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.710 align:start position:19%
lot of good around the world and there's

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:49.930 align:start position:19%
some things that we do that are either

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:51.370 align:start position:19%
ineffective or imperfect but there's a

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:56.790 align:start position:19%
lot to be proud of and there's a lot to

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.790 align:start position:19%
build on
