00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.890
What are you gonna miss the most of it?

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.980
I know you're looking forward to like
you said rolling a window down and walking

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.630
and doing things that you haven't been
able to do, but what are you gonna miss?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.750
&gt;&gt; It's really the people.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.910
I think about the girls have
grown up in the White House,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.460
I mean the staff that's
there, we see them everyday.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.883
These are people who have helped us
raise our kids, they've loved us,

00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:23.980
they're taking care of us and
the minute we leave, that's it.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.510
So it's really the people
that we'll miss most.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.690
And I'm sure the girls
will have a tough time.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.770
They think they're ready, but when you've
grown up in a place, I mean imagine,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.500
they won't be able to just knock on
the door and say can I see my room.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.145
That's not going to happen.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.410
So we're trying to have them step back and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.770
really appreciate the walk on the South
Lawn, sitting on the Truman balcony.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.820
I mean so, we just wanna keep creating
some memories for them as well.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
because talk about not having perspective.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.430
They really have grown up and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.444
gotten used to that and
what an amazing experience they have had.

00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:01.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's incredible

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.540
&gt;&gt; I'm proud of them.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.670
They've really managed this so well.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.880
I just love them to death.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.130
The big thing I've always worried about
was making sure that they got out of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.280
this whole.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.780
And I'm just proud that they're poised,
smart, intelligent young women.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.476
&gt;&gt; They are, they are.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.407
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I mean.

00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:26.265
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:29.987
met them eight years ago when you brought
them here to see the Jonas Brothers.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:30.794
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:33.200
&gt;&gt; And that was the first time that
I met you and the girls outside.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.160
&gt;&gt; That's right outside, yeah.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.030
I got that picture in my dressing room.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.570
&gt;&gt; Do you?
I mean it's amazing when you look at how

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.580
long ago that was.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.490
And then of course I know
them a little bit now, and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.100
it's hard enough to raise children,
period, but to raise children in front

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.560
of everyone in the White House and they
have done, you've done an amazing job.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.988
Do you feel like and I'm sure you
did feel pressured to be the first

00:01:56.988 --> 00:02:02.820
African-American First Lady, like
there's some kind of responsibility or.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.820
&gt;&gt; Well one of the things I know from
sitting in this position that every

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.110
First Lady feels some level of pressure.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.490
I mean this is a big platform and
you don't wanna mess it up.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.020
So I wouldn't dare to compare my
experience to any former First Lady, but

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.040
I do take the role seriously.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.680
I do, as I said in my convention speech,
I know that kids are watching us.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.750
They're watching what we say,
what we do, and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.340
Barack and I have tried to make
sure that what kids are seeing

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.045
is something that they can be proud of,
because it matters.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:38.280
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.800
&gt;&gt; You have accomplished that.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.850
You have accomplished that and I know you
know that, but you should feel very proud.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.170
Both of you should feel very proud.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.410
Like I said, we will miss you so much,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.490
because it has been a joy and
I feel proud to call you a friend.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.160
&gt;&gt; It has been an honor.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.970
&gt;&gt; I mean, an honor and
I wasn't the political spouse.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.660
I was very hesitant about this, but
it's truly been an honor to serve,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.590
to travel this country,
to meet so many great people.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.940
I have so much hope for this nation and
I hope that everybody else does too.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.440
We have some great young people,
we've got great communities.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.160
I just wish everyone have the opportunity
to travel the country like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.150
we have had because you would feel
good everyday about where we live.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.435
This is the best country on Earth.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:34.224
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
