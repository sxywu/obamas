00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.803
because I have two daughters,
as well.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.405 align:start position:0% line:85%
Can't beat daughters.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.405 align:start size:63% position:38%
You can't, right?

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.973 size:66% position:33%
You cannot
beat daughters.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.376
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.412 size:69% position:34%
Sons out there,
I'm not offending you.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.414 size:75% position:38%
I'm just stating a fact.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:16.815 align:start size:91% position:9% line:92%
Can't beat 'em.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:16.815 align:start size:22% position:78%
Yeah.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.717 align:start size:66% position:34%
I saw a picture of --

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.053 align:start size:66% position:34%
Do Sasha and Malia --

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.821 align:end position:100%
Do they enjoy living
in the White House?

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.989
They can't wait --
Is it like "Frozen" for them?

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.659 align:end position:100%
"Hey, we're sisters.
Do you wanna build a snowman?"

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.028 size:66% position:67%
You live in a palace.
Like, is it fun?

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:33.733 align:start position:0%
I think Malia, who will
be graduating this week,

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.668 size:63% position:31%
is very eager
to get out of there.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.036
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.205
What is that going to be like,
the graduation?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.475 align:start position:0%
I've got some sunglasses
and I'm just gonna --

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.177 size:63% position:69%
You're getting
weepy there.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.347 size:75% position:38%
One more example
of the president crying.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's gonna be bad.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.049 align:start size:56% position:44%
You can't, yeah.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.352 size:69% position:34%
Sasha, she was younger
when she got there,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.753 size:69% position:34%
so she's
more accustomed to it.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.054 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.656 size:84% position:42%
But, you know,
they've handled it so well.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.726 size:78% position:39%
They are wonderful girls.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.496 size:75% position:38%
They're smart and funny.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.897 size:66% position:33%
But most importantly,
they're kind.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.165 size:66% position:33%
They don't
have an attitude.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.468 align:start position:0%
This is the thing Michelle and I
were most worried about

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
when we got there.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start position:0%
We thought, you know,
"How's this gonna work?"

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.440 size:75% position:38%
You've got these butlers

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.242 size:78% position:39%
and you've got, you know,
guys saluting.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:20.112 align:start position:0%
And it's a testimony to Michelle
and my mother-in-law

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.882 align:start position:0%
that they have just turned out
to be incredible kids.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.183 align:start position:0%
I could not be prouder.

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:27.019 align:end position:100%
I saw a photo of them
at this event they were at.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.789 size:66% position:67%
And Sasha was talking
to Ryan Reynolds,

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start size:53% position:47%
Hollywood hunk
Ryan Reynolds.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.059 size:75% position:38%
He's a good-looking guy.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.226 size:75% position:63%
He's a good-looking guy,
yeah.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:35.561 size:66% position:33%
He's better-looking
than us.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.062 align:start size:50% position:50%
He is, yeah.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start size:78% position:22%
But it's the best because
Malia's in the background

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.303 size:75% position:63%
behind Ryan,
and she's going, "Yeah."

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.737
[ Laughter ]

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.338 size:59% position:70%
I have the photo,
because I found it.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.406 align:start size:75% position:25%
'Cause it's my favorite.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.674 align:start size:69% position:31%
Look how cute that is.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:49.442 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.243
[ Laughter ]

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:55.781
You have to make T-shirts and
embarrass Sasha on her birthday

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.216 size:84% position:58%
and make all of her friends
wear them.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.518 align:start position:0%
I think it's fair to say I
embarrass her without T-shirts.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:00.787 align:start size:47% position:53%
[ Laughs ]

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.389 size:88% position:44%
Yeah, that's one of my great
gifts is embarrassing Sasha.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.724 align:start size:53% position:47%
As a dad, yeah.
