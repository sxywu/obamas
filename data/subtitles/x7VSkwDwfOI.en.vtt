We have to, have to,
have to talk

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.202 align:start size:59% position:41% line:85%
about the election.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.202 align:start size:78% position:22%
Do we?

[ Light laughter ]

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.571 align:start size:59% position:41%
We really do, yeah.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.072 align:start size:56% position:44%
I think so, yeah.

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:08.841 align:start size:63% position:38%
Now, this past week,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.812 align:end position:100%
Hillary is now the presumptive
nominee for the Democrats.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.413 align:start size:81% position:19%
And you talked to Hillary.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:15.682 align:start size:78% position:22% line:92%
I did.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:15.682 align:start size:28% position:72%
Yeah.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.949
Did you talk to her during --
as she's running?

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.184 size:59% position:70%
Do they ask you
for advice?

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I've actually spoken
to Hillary and Bernie

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.822 size:63% position:31%
at certain points
during the campaign.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.459 size:88% position:44%
And I don't know
if they asked me for advice,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.795 align:start position:0%
but I give it anyway.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.396
[ Laughter ]

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.631 align:start size:56% position:44%
They wouldn't --

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.433 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you know what?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.901 align:start position:0%
It was a healthy thing
for the Democratic Party

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.704 size:63% position:31%
to have
a contested primary.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.839 size:66% position:33%
I thought
that Bernie Sanders

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.244 size:72% position:36%
brought enormous energy
and new ideas

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.081 align:start position:0%
and he pushed the party
and challenged them.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.449 size:78% position:39%
I thought it made Hillary
a better candidate.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.119 size:81% position:41%
I think she is whip-smart,

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.089 align:start size:88% position:13%
she is tough,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.725 align:start position:0%
and she deeply cares
about working people

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.961 size:63% position:31%
and putting kids
through school

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.230 size:81% position:41%
and making sure
we're growing our economy.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.967
So my hope is that
over the next couple of weeks,

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.469 size:63% position:31%
we're able to pull
things together.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.904 align:start size:94% position:6%
And what happens
during primaries,

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:12.838 align:start position:0%
you get a little ouchy.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.073 align:start size:91% position:9%
Everybody does.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.343 size:63% position:31%
When Hillary and I
ran in 2008,

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:21.947 size:81% position:41%
you know,
your staff and supporters,

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.216 align:start position:0%
they're popping off.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.084 align:start position:0%
And somebody's reading --
"Did you see what that per--"

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.887 size:63% position:31% line:91%
And they start
spinning stuff up.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.887 align:start size:25% position:75%
Sure.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.321 size:66% position:33%
So there's
a natural process

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.690 size:75% position:38%
of everybody recognizing

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.826 size:69% position:34%
that this is not about
any individual,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:34.927 size:66% position:33%
but this is about
the country

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.095 size:72% position:36%
and the direction
we're going to take it.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.998 align:start position:0%
And I think we're going
to have a great convention

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.132 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we'll do well.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:43.002 size:78% position:61%
Now, is Bernie
going to endorse Hillary?

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start position:0%
Well, I'm sure they're going
to have a conversation.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.307 size:59% position:70%
Is he ever
gonna drop out?

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.808
[ Laughter ]

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start size:78% position:22%
Or he's going to stay in?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.244 size:72% position:36%
I'm going to be talking
to him tomorrow.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.680 size:72% position:36%
He's going to be coming
to the White House.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.449 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the main role

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.551 size:72% position:36%
I'm going to be playing
in this process

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.954 size:66% position:33%
is to remind
the American people

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.856 size:63% position:31%
that this is
a serious job.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.659 align:start position:0%
This is not reality TV.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.397 align:start position:0%
I've seen the decisions
that have to be made

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.499 size:63% position:31%
and the work
that has to be done.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.868 size:66% position:33%
And I have
a lot of confidence

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:19.138 size:84% position:42%
that if the American people

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.173 size:63% position:31%
are reminded
of what's at stake

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:23.842 size:69% position:34%
and all the incredibly
important issues

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.145 size:78% position:39%
that we got to get right,

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.912 size:81% position:41%
that they're going to make
a good choice.

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.248 size:63% position:31%
That's what
they usually do.
