00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.500
- Hi there.
- Hey!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.700
- I wanna call you "Michelle"

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.200
'cause I feel like
you're my pal,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.900
but there's a proper name
I'm supposed to call you.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.300
- "Michelle" is good.
- Mrs.? Madame? Michelle?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.633
- I don't know.
"Michelle" is just fine.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.633
- All right.
- What should I call you?

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.633
- Madame Ellen.
- Okay.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.066
How's everybody doing?

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
- Everybody's good.
- Yeah?

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.333
How are the girls?
How old are they now?

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.366
- Malia is 16.
- Ooh.

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.766
- Ooh, I know.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.133
- That's driving age.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.966
- She's driving.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.133
- Is she really?

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.000
- She is.
Look out, D.C.!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
She's on the road.
Yeah, she's a driver.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
She drives to school
every day.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.833
- Really?
- And Sasha's 13.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.266
So eighth grade
and a junior in high school.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.033
- And how's the teenage girls
years going?

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.233
- They're doing okay.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.933
I mean, you know,
so far so good.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.000
Let me knock on everything.
- Yeah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.166
- You know,
but they're still sweet.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.800
They still kinda like us.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.133
But they generally
don't really want

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.233
to spend any time with us.
- Yeah.

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.700
- You know, so...
But they're good.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.100
- So they're just typical
teenage girls.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.866
- They are so typical,
and I love it.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm so proud of them.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600
I think they've just managed
this interesting journey

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.633
with just a lot
of grace and poise.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.066
I'm really proud of 'em, so...

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.500
- Yeah, that's a lot
for teenagers to go through,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.900
teenage years,
much less being the daughters

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.366
of the president
and the first lady.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.733
- They're doing it.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.900
- Do they ask about
Auntie Ellen?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.400
- In fact,
Sasha was very upset

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.233
that she was in school today.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.766
She would have loved
to come with me.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.966
- Oh, really?

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.466
- Yeah, they ask about you
all the time.

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.866
They love you.
- Oh, well, I love them.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.566
- Everybody loves Ellen, right?

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.133
[cheers and applause]

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.933
They wanna know--Malia
in particular wants to know

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.900
where her college fund
check is.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.000
- Oh.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.100
- When that's gonna be
deposited into--

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.866
But, you know,
we've got a year or so--

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.600
- No, no, let me talk
to Shutterfly, 'cause we, uh--

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.666
I can help them out.
I will fund them for sure.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.933
What about college?

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.866
Are they gonna go
far, far away or...

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.366
- You know,
we don't know yet.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.066
We're in that process,
can you believe it?

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:02.300
College visits and tests
and all that, all the drama.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.433
But she's a junior,
so she's got one more year

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.100
before she's actually applying.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100
- And do they wanna be
in politics or--

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.100
- No!
- No?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.300
- No.
- No.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.133
- No. Absolutely not.
- Yeah.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.100
Do you wanna be in politics?
- No.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.400
No.
Absolutely not.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800
- Yeah, it's a tough gig,
isn't it?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
- You know, it's--
it's important work.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.300
- Yes.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.066
- But you have to have
the personality

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.266
and the passion
for the politics.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.066
- Yeah.
- I just wanna help folks.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.700
I'm like you, you know?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.033
I just wanna make sure--

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.700
[cheers and applause]

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.833
And you can do that
in so many different ways.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.900
Politics is one
important form to do it,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.033
and I'm glad there are people
who are willing

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:43.500
to roll up their sleeves,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.433
but I leave it to those folks

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.166
and, you know,
I'll find other ways

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.433
to keep giving back.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:49.833
- Yeah, there's a lot of ways
to help people,

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.066
and you are helping people.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.866
And so 22 years of marriage,
right?

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.500
- 22.
- 22 years of marriage.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500
- Yeah.
- And--

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.433
[cheers and applause]

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:01.900
There's gotta be--

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.733
You know, you can't say
much about him

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:05.800
that would be bad or nasty,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.200
but there have to be
things that bug you.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.300
Like, does he have a habit
that's annoying?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.666
- You know,
let me say this

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.533
about the two decades
of marriage, plus,

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.333
is that what I've come
to find out

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.766
is that you don't sweat
the small stuff.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.133
You know, you--

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.433
You know, the journey
that we've taken together,

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.200
the fun we've had,
the challenges we've faced,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.900
the two beautiful girls
that we're raising.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.233
I kinda give him a pass now

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:33.200
when he leaves his socks
on the floor

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.733
or tells that story
for the 100th time.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:37.866
- Uh-huh.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:39.633
- And, you know,
wants us to, like,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.566
laugh at it like as if
we first heard it, so...

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:44.933
- Right. Well, he's got
to have good stories though.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.100
I mean, whatever
his hundredth story--

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.133
- Well, you know,
as good of a story--

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.400
- I see, I see.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.633
- You know,
100 times is a lot.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.333
- Yeah, no.
I understand.
