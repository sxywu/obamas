00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.800
I cannot tell you or thank you enough for
what you have done for

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
the gay communities.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.808
So, thank you.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:08.266
&gt;&gt; Well, it was,

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.645
it's one of the things
that I'm proudest of,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.813
because my whole political
career has based on the idea

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:23.950
that we constantly want to include
people and not exclude them.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.958
How do we bring more and
more people into opportunity and

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.465
success and
feeling hopeful about their lives?

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:35.947
But I will say, we were driving
over here today and I meant this,

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:39.931
I said it to my staff,
I said as much as we done with laws and

00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:44.912
ending Don't Ask, Don't Tell,
etc., changing hearts and minds,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:49.257
I don't think anybody's more
influential than you on that.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:49.822
I really mean that.

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:52.715
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:59.215
So the-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:00.898
&gt;&gt; Your courage and,

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:05.272
you're just really likable and so-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:09.423
&gt;&gt; So, as soon you being willing to claim

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:15.134
who you were then suddenly
empowers other people and

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:19.028
then suddenly it's your brother,

00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:23.829
it's your uncle, it's your best friend,

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.452
it's your coworkers, and
then attitudes shift.

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:34.624
And the laws followed, but
it started with folks like you.

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.730
I'm so proud of you.
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, that's-

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.317
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.

00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:39.336
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Really sweet, thank you.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:39.855
&gt;&gt; It's true.

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.334
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:47.519
&gt;&gt; I'm not really gay.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:51.107
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But on TV, you play one, and

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:52.135
it was great.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.410
&gt;&gt; I know,
I just thought it would work, and-

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.095
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.065
&gt;&gt; I've had to stick with it,

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.250
cuz people responded well.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.685
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sort of like the dancing thing.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:00.555
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.

00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:02.535
&gt;&gt; You just kinda keep on going.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:03.035
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
