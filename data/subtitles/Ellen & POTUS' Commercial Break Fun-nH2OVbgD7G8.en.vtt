I'm sure you heard the president
was here on Friday.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.505
And if you didn't hear,
the president was here on Friday.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.481
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.719
we had some really great conversations
during the commercial breaks.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.829
And luckily, our mics were still on so
we caught it.

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.400
And the cameras were rolling so
I thought I'd show you some now.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.880
&gt;&gt; Please take a selfie with me.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.486
&gt;&gt; I don't have time for that.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.031
&gt;&gt; Come on, please?

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:20.775
I'm begging you.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:23.967
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
[LAUGH]

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; Where's the lady with my pudding?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.428
Here she comes.

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:29.214
Mm, yum, yum, yum, yum.

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.842
Tell me a classic joke, I love this.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.650
&gt;&gt; What's Michelle Obama's
favorite vegetable?

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.485
&gt;&gt; Hm, what is Michelle Obama's
favorite vegetable?

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:39.088
&gt;&gt; Barack-oli.

00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:41.379
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Get it?

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.782
&gt;&gt; Will you be at the next
Illuminati meeting?

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Portia and I are both coming.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.398
&gt;&gt; Okay, the Pope will be there but
Beyonce can't make it.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:51.647
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; That's what happened.
