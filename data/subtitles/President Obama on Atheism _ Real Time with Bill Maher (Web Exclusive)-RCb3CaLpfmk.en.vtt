00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180 align:start position:19%
I don't have anybody from my tribe of

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.130 align:start position:19%
atheists ever thank you for giving us a

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679 align:start position:19%
shout out at your first inaugural but

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840 align:start position:19%
you didn't mention non-believers you i

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.040 align:start position:19%
think it was pardoned once more than

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.960 align:start position:19%
what I I mean it's not just in that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.859 align:start position:19%
speech I've done it off well we

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.869 align:start position:19%
appreciate it it because we do feel like

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.250 align:start position:19%
Untouchables to a degree i mean i don't

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.960 align:start position:19%
know if you saw the latest religion

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.330 align:start position:19%
survey but almost a quarter of the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519 align:start position:19%
country are nuns i don't mean the ones

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.219 align:start position:19%
who hit me on the knuckles with a ruler

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350 align:start position:19%
and sunday school I mean they put none

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.640 align:start position:19%
for religion of the above right right

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.469 align:start position:19%
there not know they're atheists

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:19%
agnostics or they just don't want to get

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.379 align:start position:19%
up on sunday right morning and we have

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:19%
no representation in Congress if if our

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.370 align:start position:19%
numbers are represented be over a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.739 align:start position:19%
hundred congresspeople right who felt

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.829 align:start position:19%
that way it just seems like we are not

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start position:19%
included in the basket of diversity in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.309 align:start position:19%
America which is odd because we are the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:19%
biggest minority that is a bigger

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.770 align:start position:19%
minority than any other minority you can

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.690 align:start position:19%
name

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729 align:start position:19%
oh don't you think we should get a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.189 align:start position:19%
little more love how you know I i guess

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.100 align:start position:19%
my question would be whether there is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.100 align:start position:19%
active persecution of atheists i think

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.979 align:start position:19%
that there are certain well I i think

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.659 align:start position:19%
for like a grande taille I think you're

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.689 align:start position:19%
right that there are certain we might be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.140 align:start position:19%
occupations probably most prominently

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.170 align:start position:19%
politics where there would be a bias

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630 align:start position:19%
against somebody's who's agnostic or

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210 align:start position:19%
atheist in running for office

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.009 align:start position:19%
I think that's still true outside of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990 align:start position:19%
that arena though that you seem to have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:19%
done all right with your TV show i am at

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.420 align:start position:19%
I don't get it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.939 align:start position:19%
since i'm doing the extent that they're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:19%
boycotting cutes because of your other

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.020 align:start position:19%
wacky ideas rather than your particular

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590 align:start position:19%
view are related

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.630 align:start position:19%
whatever better wet yeah the you know i

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.490 align:start position:19%
usually agree with you I i think i think

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.680 align:start position:19%
the the average American if they go to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.509 align:start position:19%
the workplace somebody's next to them

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:19%
that they're not poking around trying to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.300 align:start position:19%
figure out what their religious beliefs

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.880 align:start position:19%
are so so so II here's what i would say

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.550 align:start position:19%
that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:20.140 align:start position:19%
that I think that we should foster a

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.730 align:start position:19%
culture in which people's private

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.030 align:start position:19%
religious beliefs including atheists and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.440 align:start position:19%
agnostics are respected and and that's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.540 align:start position:19%
the kind of culture that I think allows

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.490 align:start position:19%
all of us than to believe what we want

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.690 align:start position:19%
that's freedom of conscience that's what

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.850 align:start position:19%
our Constitution guarantees and you know

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:51.310 align:start position:19%
where we get into problems typically is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.410 align:start position:19%
when our personal religious faith or the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.420 align:start position:19%
community of faith that we participated

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.450 align:start position:19%
in tips into a sort of fundamentalist

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.600 align:start position:19%
extremism in which it's not enough for

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.530 align:start position:19%
us to believe what we believe but we

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.540 align:start position:19%
start feeling obligated to you know hit

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:19%
you over the head because you don't

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.650 align:start position:19%
believe the same thing or to treat you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.740 align:start position:19%
as as somebody who's who's less than

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.630 align:start position:19%
than i am but we have to be more Pro

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.880 align:start position:19%
science in America if we were less

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.820 align:start position:19%
religious don't you think well you know

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:28.780 align:start position:19%
i think the the the issues we have with

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:32.230 align:start position:19%
science these days are not restricted to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.790 align:start position:19%
two what's happening with respect to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.580 align:start position:19%
religion I there a lot of free related

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150 align:start position:19%
scientists around i think the problem is

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.560 align:start position:19%
is that in our school systems and to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:19%
some degree and this is where it is

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.750 align:start position:19%
relevant with school boards around the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.690 align:start position:19%
country that are mandating curriculums

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.990 align:start position:19%
and textbooks you start seeing this

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.320 align:start position:19%
weird watering down of scientific fact

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.580 align:start position:19%
so that are our kids are growing up in

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.350 align:start position:19%
an environment and disconnects will go

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.580 align:start position:19%
to what i was saying earlier about the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:07.330 align:start position:19%
media where everything's contested that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.500 align:start position:19%
that nothing is true because if it's on

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.430 align:start position:19%
facebook

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.129 align:start position:19%
it all looks the same

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.669 align:start position:19%
and if you're reading something from a

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:22.009 align:start position:19%
nobel-prize-winning physicist next to

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:19%
some guy in his underwear writing in his

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.180 align:start position:19%
basement

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:19%
yeah or his mom's basement in on texted

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.070 align:start position:19%
it looks like it's equally plausible and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.340 align:start position:19%
and part of what we have to do a better

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.530 align:start position:19%
job of if our democracies of function in

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.350 align:start position:19%
a complicated diverse society like this

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.900 align:start position:19%
is to teach our kids enough critical

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:49.009 align:start position:19%
thinking to be able to sort out what is

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.610 align:start position:19%
true and what is false

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.099 align:start position:19%
what is contestable and and what is

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:19%
incontestable and and we seem to have

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:19%
have trouble with that and and are our

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:19%
political system doesn't help
