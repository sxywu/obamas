AFTER EVERY SUPER BOWL I CALL
THE WINNING TEAM AND

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:12.166 align:start position:0%
CONGRATULATE THEM, AND SOMETIMES
I ALSO CALL THE LOSING TEAM,

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:13.766

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.300 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.966 align:start position:0%
OF COURSE, I DO.

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:11.333 size:81% position:41%
IT WAS THE DENVER BRONCOS.

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT!

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
IF IT WAS A PRETAPE, HOW COULD
YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:19.633
