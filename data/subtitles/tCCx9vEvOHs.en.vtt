00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.330
You know I've been doing this show a long,
long time and you won't believe this

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.985
I started doing this show back
when headphones still had cords.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.073
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But today something is happening that's

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:12.890
never happened before in
the history of this show.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.158
Today, I'm co-hosting with
the First Lady of the United States.

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:25.158
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.396
&gt;&gt; I know, isn't this exciting,
what an honor for her.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:34.827
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
[LAUGH]

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:35.432
&gt;&gt; Michelle and

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:37.030
I had been preparing all day long.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.120
The First Lady has been
studying up on the guests.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.305
I spent the last two hours
patting myself down.

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:44.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I'm ready, I think she's ready.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.880
So please welcome my co-host for
the day, the First Lady,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.096
Michelle Obama
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:59.096
[MUSIC]

00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:26.945
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Have a seat.

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:28.385
Thank you for being my co-host.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.895
And you're gonna have to squat
a little bit cuz you're too tall.

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.906
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I think I'm gonna regret saying this,

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:35.789
but I should wear heels.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.380
&gt;&gt; You're a little-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.469
&gt;&gt; No, you're good down there.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.492
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Uh-uh, no, no.

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:42.274
See, you're still competitive,
you're still competitive.

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:43.456
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right,

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:47.655
so I'm sure you know the number one job
of co-host is to make the host look good.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:49.345
So that's your first job.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:53.729
&gt;&gt; Well, that's an easy job for
me because you already look so good.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.477
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:57.777
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Was that believable?

00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:58.762
&gt;&gt; Weâ€™ll work on that.

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:00.291
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:02.922
&gt;&gt; All right, and
you watch my show every day so

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:06.206
I'm pretty sure you know
what happens next, do this.

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:09.893
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And now the First Lady
of the United States and

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:13.598
the First Lady of
Daytime Television shall dance.

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:14.917
&gt;&gt; We shall dance.
[MUSIC]

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:24.917
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.718
&gt;&gt; I am so glad you're here.

00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:42.200
So, you came in a huge motorcade.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.556
Where did you all park?

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:45.369
&gt;&gt; We parked right out front.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.441
&gt;&gt; You parked in front?

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:47.095
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.266
&gt;&gt; Michelle you should have asked me.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.124
No, you can't park there after 3 o'clock.

00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:52.961
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Do we have a security camera to see

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.158
what's happening there?

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:56.242
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So while they're there-

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.074
&gt;&gt; That's us, everything looks good.

00:02:57.074 --> 00:02:58.296
&gt;&gt; That's y'all.

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.536
You're getting a ticket.

00:03:00.536 --> 00:03:01.318
No.

00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:03.132
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're getting-

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:06.277
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:07.520
&gt;&gt; Why didn't you give me some,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.370
don't you have guest passes or something?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.470
&gt;&gt; No, no.
&gt;&gt; I thought we were good out there.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.061
&gt;&gt; No, I'm so sorry.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:15.445
You were supposed to park in the structure
across the street like everybody else.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.299
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Someone's gonna be in trouble.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.751
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, they're downtown and
it's $600 a car so that's good.

00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:21.726
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
