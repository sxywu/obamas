and they always have stories
about meeting you

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:05.771 size:63% position:69%
and fumbling
and getting nervous.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.606 size:63% position:69%
I don't know
if you remember,

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:10.143 align:end position:100%
the first time I met you
and the First Lady,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.646
I was doing stand-up comedy at a
barbecue for military families.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.381 size:66% position:33%
That was great.
We so appreciated it.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.283 size:63% position:69%
Yeah. Thank you.
I loved it, as well.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.419 align:end position:100%
And I was opening up
for the Foo Fighters.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.487 align:end position:100%
It was Fourth of July
in the White House.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.956
And I get there.
I was so nervous to meet you.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:26.593
I was Googling how to say hello
to the First Lady.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.662 align:start size:72% position:28%
Like, do I say, "Hello,
First Lady, Mrs. Obama.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.830 align:start size:75% position:25%
Mrs. Obama, First Lady."

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.164 align:end size:94% position:94%
I didn't know
how to say it.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.766 size:78% position:39%
I think you actually said
all of them.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.900 align:start size:72% position:28%
I think I actually did.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.469
Well, I wore a three-piece suit
that day

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.073 align:end position:100%
because I was very --
I just wanted to impress you.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.540
[ Light laughter ]

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.177 align:end position:100%
But it was an outdoor event
on the Fourth of July,

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.345 size:84% position:58%
and I remember I got there,

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:49.382 align:end position:100%
and Dave Grohl was there
in board shirts and a T-shirt.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start size:75% position:25%
He goes, "You look hot."

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.985 align:end position:100%
I go, "I really am.
It's really boiling.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.154 align:start size:53% position:47%
This is crazy."

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.656 size:72% position:64%
I go, "Aren't you
meeting the president?"

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.725 align:end position:100%
He goes -- Basically saying,
"We're the Foo Fighters.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.927 align:start size:50% position:50%
We dress --"
I go, "Yeah."

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.296 align:start size:78% position:22%
And then we wait in line,

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.297 align:end position:100%
because we're going to get
our picture taken with you guys.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.599 size:63% position:69%
I was so nervous
to meet you.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.135 size:66% position:67%
And I went up
and I was practicing,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.137 size:78% position:61%
like, "Hello, First Lady,
Mrs. First Lady."

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.506 align:start size:56% position:44%
And I walk over,

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.175 align:end position:100%
and the First Lady starts
laughing and looking at me.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.411 align:end position:100%
She goes, "Oh, honey,
oh, my gosh, you're so sweaty,"

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.179 align:start size:59% position:41%
and took my tie --

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.581 size:66% position:67%
This is a true story.
Loosened my tie.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.849 align:start size:63% position:38%
And I looked at you,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.753 align:end position:100%
and you had a short-sleeved
shirt and khakis on.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.588 size:63% position:69%
I go, "Hello,
Mr. President, sir."

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.556 size:78% position:61%
And you go,
"Didn't you get the memo?

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:31.757 align:start size:56% position:44%
It's a barbecue."

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.626
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:42.468 align:end position:100%
They took the picture
and they escorted me out.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.304 size:59% position:70%
And then I hadn't
seen you since.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.405
[ Laughter ]

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.340 size:66% position:67%
I was just wondering,
do people get --

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.109 size:72% position:64%
do you have any stories
like that,

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.412 align:end position:100%
where people are just
so embarrassing like that

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.380 size:78% position:61%
and you tried
to make them feel better?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.983 size:81% position:41%
Um...
nothing that embarrassing.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.518
[ Laughter ]

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.289 size:78% position:39%
I think that was actually
the peak of awkwardness.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.693 size:63% position:69%
Yeah, perfect.
Thank you.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.595 align:end position:100%
Can I just ask you
just straight up,

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.729 size:72% position:64%
what is the first thing
you're going to do

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.565 size:69% position:66%
when you leave office,
do you know?

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.835 size:88% position:44%
I'm going to get some sleep,
that's for sure.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start size:47% position:53%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.975 size:72% position:36%
You know, it's actually
a moving thing.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.277 size:63% position:31%
You're talking about
sentimentality.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.279 size:63% position:31%
But I remember
from my inauguration

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.581 size:75% position:38%
seeing President Bush --

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.782 align:start position:0%
You get on Marine One,

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.317 size:75% position:38%
and that's the last time
you get on Marine One.

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.053 size:81% position:41%
They fly you
to Andrews Air Force Base.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.021 size:66% position:33%
And then you
get on Air Force One,

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.456 size:81% position:41%
and it's your last flight.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.526 size:63% position:31%
And they'll take you
anywhere you want.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:45.831
And I think it's fair to say
that it will be someplace warm.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.767 size:66% position:33%
Because it's going to
be January,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.102 size:69% position:34%
and every inauguration
has been freezing.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.504 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.674 size:69% position:34%
And then, you know,
I think Michelle and I

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.311 size:84% position:42%
will take a break somewhere
for a couple weeks

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:04.016 align:start position:0%
and, you know, let the girls
manage for themselves.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.918 line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.918 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.421 size:78% position:39%
Hopefully they'll be okay
when we get back.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.588
[ Laughter ]

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.923 size:59% position:70%
Well, if you need
to stay warm,

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.392 size:78% position:61%
I have a three-piece suit
for you.
