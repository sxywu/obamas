00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959 align:start position:19%
ok we're here with the president we're

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.609 align:start position:19%
very excited to be here

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.230 align:start position:19%
I'm very excited to be very grateful

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.730 align:start position:19%
thank you very much

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190 align:start position:19%
you must be little wistful you must be a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.549 align:start position:19%
little like david ortiz about a month

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800 align:start position:19%
ago where you know you're you're going

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.720 align:start position:19%
on to great things in the next chapter

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.990 align:start position:19%
of your life start hitting and you're

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.640 align:start position:19%
still heading but my feeder but but you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.720 align:start position:19%
know you'll never quite have a job as

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.400 align:start position:19%
exhilarating

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.070 align:start position:19%
well you know it it is time I tell

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.430 align:start position:19%
people that this has been a great run

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.899 align:start position:19%
I have loved this job I'm not going to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.940 align:start position:19%
pretend that there haven't been moments

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:19%
of great frustration but it is a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.870 align:start position:19%
singular privilege I think I'm as good a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:19%
President now as I've ever been because

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.180 align:start position:19%
you learned stuff every eight years

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.750 align:start position:19%
you've sort of been around the track a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.489 align:start position:19%
bunch of times but I also see now the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start position:19%
wisdom of the founders that at a certain

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.610 align:start position:19%
point you have to let go for the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.290 align:start position:19%
democracy to work

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.890 align:start position:19%
sure that there has to be fresh legs

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.850 align:start position:19%
there have to be new people and you have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.600 align:start position:19%
to have the humility to recognize that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:19%
you know you're a citizen and and you go

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.759 align:start position:19%
back to being a citizen after after this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:19%
offices is over so we're just trying to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.380 align:start position:19%
run through the tape and the great thing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.070 align:start position:19%
is I've got an unbelievable team around

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.340 align:start position:19%
me of people who have done extraordinary

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.650 align:start position:19%
work i'm sort of the frontman for it and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.579 align:start position:19%
that's very modest well you know the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.700 align:start position:19%
fact that you that the team won't be

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.140 align:start position:19%
there in the same way i think is the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.340 align:start position:19%
only thing that's where you have a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:19%
little bit of regret we're a week out

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229 align:start position:19%
from the election

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.180 align:start position:19%
yeah and I you're a history buff i think

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.170 align:start position:19%
it when we look back if mr. Trump is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.390 align:start position:19%
defeated

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960 align:start position:19%
I'm hopeful that we will be the takeaway

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.299 align:start position:19%
will be that socialism was not such a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.030 align:start position:19%
dirty word anymore because of our friend

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.149 align:start position:19%
Bernie Sanders and I just wondering

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.129 align:start position:19%
where someone who

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.959 align:start position:19%
was accused of being a socialist

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.819 align:start position:19%
metaphor what do you think about the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.769 align:start position:19%
idea that in America yes we're

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.829 align:start position:19%
capitalist but some things just should

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.730 align:start position:19%
not be for the profit motive healthcare

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:27.069 align:start position:19%
prisons the military elections and i

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.540 align:start position:19%
would add news gathering people say get

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.519 align:start position:19%
the money out of politics i think you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.930 align:start position:19%
gotta get out at the news business first

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.939 align:start position:19%
we're never gonna learn anything

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.239 align:start position:19%
well it cut couple things i say first of

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:41.620 align:start position:19%
all you know if you look at the United

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:47.799 align:start position:19%
States Canada Europe all the advanced

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.799 align:start position:19%
democracies then clearly you've got to

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.040 align:start position:19%
have a market-based system because it's

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.269 align:start position:19%
really productive and it spurs on

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.639 align:start position:19%
innovation and freedom and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.480 align:start position:19%
entrepreneurship and you get have a

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:05.500 align:start position:19%
social welfare state and you in some

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.540 align:start position:19%
ways the label socialism doesn't make

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:19%
that much sense in a context where

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.060 align:start position:19%
there's no economy that doesn't have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:19%
some socialist elements meaning that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.780 align:start position:19%
there's some common goods that we all

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:19%
agree

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.849 align:start position:19%
everybody should have that's what social

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:19%
security is that's what Medicare is to

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.389 align:start position:19%
some extent that's what public schools

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.669 align:start position:19%
are we all chip in to make sure that

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.540 align:start position:19%
everybody no matter the circumstances of

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:34.780 align:start position:19%
your birth have these baseline goods and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.930 align:start position:19%
as you know i felt pretty strongly that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.889 align:start position:19%
healthcare should be one of those one of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.979 align:start position:19%
those goods

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.870 align:start position:19%
I've also said in the past that if I

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.569 align:start position:19%
were designing a system from scratch

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.639 align:start position:19%
I would have probably looked at a

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:19%
single-payer system but we do have

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.799 align:start position:19%
legacy systems and and that's the only

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.709 align:start position:19%
thing that sometimes when I've had

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.180 align:start position:19%
conversations with burning I've said to

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.389 align:start position:19%
him that we don't start from scratch

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.940 align:start position:19%
there you've got one trillion dollar

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.349 align:start position:19%
healthcare industry for example and you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.299 align:start position:19%
got a lot of people who are working for

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.569 align:start position:19%
and a lot of special interests involved

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:14.260 align:start position:19%
and so my goal in the Affordable Care

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.260 align:start position:19%
Act was if i can get millions more

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.380 align:start position:19%
people insurance then that's my first

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.789 align:start position:19%
goal because for them this is not an

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.410 align:start position:19%
abstraction it's like I'm not going to

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.420 align:start position:19%
lose my home or my kids going to get

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:19%
coverage and that's what we've done but

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.900 align:start position:19%
I see it as a starter home and then the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:19%
question is how do we make sure

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.610 align:start position:19%
everybody ultimately gets it because

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.220 align:start position:19%
there are still gaps in coverage i think

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:19%
the same is true you know when it comes

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:19%
to some other issues to me I think there

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:19%
is a pretty bright line around prisons i

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.070 align:start position:19%
agree with you that the criminal justice

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.020 align:start position:19%
system should not be affected by that

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.090 align:start position:19%
the profit motive that this is the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.090 align:start position:19%
awesome power of the state saying we can

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.490 align:start position:19%
take somebody's freedom away we can lock

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:19%
them up because they've breached some

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.110 align:start position:19%
part of the social contract that the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.300 align:start position:19%
notion that you want in you might

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:19%
incentivize people to lock more people

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.980 align:start position:19%
in or keeping their longer or not

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:19%
provide the kind of rehabilitation

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.130 align:start position:19%
services so that they can get out of

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.630 align:start position:19%
there

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.950 align:start position:19%
I think that's a problem and so I'm very

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:19%
proud of some of the work that we've

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:19%
been trying to do along these lines we

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.300 align:start position:19%
got more work to do when it comes to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.690 align:start position:19%
them the media at you know that's a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.140 align:start position:19%
tougher call because look state-run

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.730 align:start position:19%
media that's what they got in not

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:19%
state-run but just like it used to be

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.470 align:start position:19%
where it was a loss leader for that for

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:19%
the network's they didn't have to make

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.910 align:start position:19%
up a profit community is funny because

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.950 align:start position:19%
they had a monopoly though to some

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.870 align:start position:19%
degree right right so that they were fat

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:19%
and happy in this kind of environment

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:54.460 align:start position:19%
it's hard to figure out how you would do

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:19%
that but you know the I think the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:19%
question I'd have when it comes to the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:06.760 align:start position:19%
media is how do we create a space where

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.480 align:start position:19%
truth gets eyeballs and his entertaining

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.060 align:start position:19%
and we can build a common conversation

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.260 align:start position:19%
at a what is true when i leave here one

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.890 align:start position:19%
of the things I'm most concerned about

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:21.130 align:start position:19%
is the balkanization of the media where

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:24.460 align:start position:19%
you've got 800 stations you got all

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:19%
these websites people have difficulty

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.770 align:start position:19%
now just sorting out what's true and

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.350 align:start position:19%
what's not

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.289 align:start position:19%
yeah and if you don't have some common

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.150 align:start position:19%
baseline effects do you eat we can have

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.009 align:start position:19%
a disagreement about how to deal with

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.099 align:start position:19%
climate change but if

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.830 align:start position:19%
we have a big chunk of the country that

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.439 align:start position:19%
share just discounts what 99% of

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.619 align:start position:19%
scientists a completely it's very hard

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:50.020 align:start position:19%
to figure out how we move the democracy

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.089 align:start position:19%
forward so I don't have a good formula

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.189 align:start position:19%
for that but i think that it's something

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:56.889 align:start position:19%
that I'll spend a lot of time thinking

00:06:54.189 --> 00:07:00.789 align:start position:19%
about and seeing if maybe we can build

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:04.180 align:start position:19%
some platforms where everybody says okay

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:19%
let's uh let's let's agree on facts and

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.159 align:start position:19%
then argue about means after that

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.139 align:start position:19%
okay let me ask you about a question

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.029 align:start position:19%
that I know people who watch our show

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.669 align:start position:19%
were interested in riches marijuana

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:19.210 align:start position:19%
reform is that something that you care

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:21.819 align:start position:19%
about is something I care about its now

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.710 align:start position:19%
we both made jokes about it but it's not

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.449 align:start position:19%
funny to the people who get arrested

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.139 align:start position:19%
yeah which is over half a million i

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:19%
think last year it you know you and I

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:34.509 align:start position:19%
both could have had our lives ruined not

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:37.689 align:start position:19%
really by smoking it but by being

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:39.610 align:start position:19%
arrested for it right and you know I

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:41.050 align:start position:19%
feel like you had a checklist about

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:19%
let's get rid of a lot of the stupid

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.419 align:start position:19%
stuff like opening up Cuba you know you

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.309 align:start position:19%
came out for gay marriage

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.349 align:start position:19%
I was hoping ending the drug war would

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:52.539 align:start position:19%
be on that list it's on the ballot now

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:55.209 align:start position:19%
in nine states in a week including

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:57.669 align:start position:19%
California for recreational and Arizona

00:07:55.209 --> 00:08:00.370 align:start position:19%
and medical in places like North Dakota

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:02.979 align:start position:19%
is meantime the federal government

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:07.269 align:start position:19%
caught up to progressive states like

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:10.539 align:start position:19%
Arizona and North Dakota well IE here

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:16.509 align:start position:19%
here's what I'm i have always believed

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:21.430 align:start position:19%
that to the extent that the society

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:19%
legitimately wants to guard against any

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.999 align:start position:19%
kind of substance abuse that you treated

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.830 align:start position:19%
as a public health problem

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:30.980 align:start position:19%
look I'm an ex-smoker cigarette smoke

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:34.340 align:start position:19%
x.x and really yeah

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:19%
I read your banker did you get some

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.270 align:start position:19%
money right there is thought I got away

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:44.090 align:start position:19%
I i'm sure the heck out of Nicorette

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:47.660 align:start position:19%
really yeah but know what I when I

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.730 align:start position:19%
passed healthcare reform that would I

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:19%
think right I'd had my last cigarette

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:57.260 align:start position:19%
butt but the reason is because there was

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.250 align:start position:19%
this enormous public health effort to

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:04.940 align:start position:19%
get kids not to pick up smoking and to

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:08.510 align:start position:19%
make sure that parents felt guilty if if

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.630 align:start position:19%
they were passing on that that habit to

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:16.190 align:start position:19%
their kids and I've and so that's where

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:20.840 align:start position:19%
I think we need to go with pot alcohol

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:23.810 align:start position:19%
and so so I don't think that

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.730 align:start position:19%
legalization is a panacea but i think

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:29.210 align:start position:19%
that we're going to have to have a more

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:31.730 align:start position:19%
serious conversation about how we are

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:19%
treating marijuana and our drug laws

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:38.510 align:start position:19%
generally the good news is that after

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.450 align:start position:19%
this referenda to some degree is going

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:19%
to call the question because if in fact

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.980 align:start position:19%
it past and all these states you know

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.660 align:start position:19%
about a fifth of the country that's

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.570 align:start position:19%
operating under one set of laws

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:54.860 align:start position:19%
yeah and four-fifths in another the

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:19%
Justice Department DEA FBI for them to

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.390 align:start position:19%
try to straddle and figure out how

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.460 align:start position:19%
they're supposed to enforce laws in some

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:05.300 align:start position:19%
places and not in others and they're

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:19%
going to guard against transferred

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:12.050 align:start position:19%
transporting these drugs across state

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:19%
lines but you've got the entire Pacific

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.970 align:start position:19%
chair corridor where where this is this

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.310 align:start position:19%
is legal

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:22.430 align:start position:19%
that is not going to be tenable now it's

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:25.550 align:start position:19%
not something that I think is going to

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.500 align:start position:19%
happen overnight and then third some

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.170 align:start position:19%
legitimate concerns that people have

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:34.010 align:start position:19%
about how you draw lines on these issues

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.840 align:start position:19%
but it is indisputable that right now

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:19%
the biggest drug crisis we have is with

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:19%
opioids many of which are legal and are

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.410 align:start position:19%
ravaging

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.190 align:start position:19%
entire communities all across the

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:19%
country and and though for us to

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.110 align:start position:19%
resource how we think about these

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:19%
problems and not think of everything

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.410 align:start position:19%
through the criminal justice lens but

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.520 align:start position:19%
also through the public health lens i

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.270 align:start position:19%
think it's something that's going to

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.610 align:start position:19%
need to have okay switching topics I

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:06.030 align:start position:19%
don't have anybody from my tribe of

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:19%
atheists ever thank you for giving us a

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.290 align:start position:19%
shout out at your first inaugural but

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:19%
you didn't mention non-believers ask you

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.950 align:start position:19%
i think it was pardoned once more than

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:19%
what I mean it's not just a minute

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:19%
speech I've done it often

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.570 align:start position:19%
well we appreciate it because we do feel

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.650 align:start position:19%
like Untouchables to a degree i mean i

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.690 align:start position:19%
don't know if you saw the latest

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.910 align:start position:19%
religion survey but almost a quarter of

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.310 align:start position:19%
the country are nuns i don't mean the

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:19%
ones who hit me on the knuckles with a

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.900 align:start position:19%
ruler in Sunday school I mean they put

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.490 align:start position:19%
non for religion of the above right

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:19%
right there not know they're atheists

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.130 align:start position:19%
agnostics or they just don't want to get

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:19%
up on sunday right morning and we have

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.730 align:start position:19%
no representation in congress of if our

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:19%
numbers are represented to be over a

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.330 align:start position:19%
hundred congresspeople right who felt

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:53.250 align:start position:19%
that way right

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:56.250 align:start position:19%
it just seems like we are not included

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.870 align:start position:19%
in the basket of diversity in America

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.850 align:start position:19%
which is odd because we are the biggest

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:19%
minority that is a bigger minority than

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:19%
any other minority you can name

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.210 align:start position:19%
oh don't you think we should get a

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:19%
little more love how you know i guess my

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.950 align:start position:19%
question would be whether there is

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.950 align:start position:19%
active persecution of atheists i think

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:19%
that there are certain well I i think

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:21.510 align:start position:19%
for granted a tie i think you're right

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:19%
that there are certain we might be

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:27.990 align:start position:19%
occupations probably most prominently

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:31.020 align:start position:19%
politics where there would be a bias

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:19%
against somebody's who's agnostic or

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:19%
atheist in running for office

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:19%
I think that's still true outside of

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.840 align:start position:19%
that arena though that you seem to have

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:19%
done all right with your TV show i am at

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.090 align:start position:19%
I don't get it

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.370 align:start position:19%
since then I'm going the extent that

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:47.020 align:start position:19%
they're boycotting cutes because of your

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.370 align:start position:19%
other wacky ideas rather than

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:19%
your particular view our relationship

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:54.490 align:start position:19%
whatever better wet idea the you know i

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.350 align:start position:19%
usually agree with you I i think i think

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:01.570 align:start position:19%
the the average American if they go to

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.370 align:start position:19%
the workplace somebody's next to them

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:19%
that they're not poking around trying to

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:19%
figure out what their religious beliefs

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:15.400 align:start position:19%
are so so so II here's what i would say

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:19.990 align:start position:19%
that I think that we should foster a

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:24.610 align:start position:19%
culture in which people's private

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:19%
religious beliefs including atheists and

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:32.290 align:start position:19%
agnostics are respected and and that's

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.390 align:start position:19%
the kind of culture that I think allows

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.340 align:start position:19%
all of us than to believe what we want

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:40.540 align:start position:19%
that's freedom of conscience that's what

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:45.640 align:start position:19%
our Constitution guarantees and you know

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:19%
where we get into problems typically is

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:53.290 align:start position:19%
when our personal religious faith or the

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.300 align:start position:19%
community of faith that we participated

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.300 align:start position:19%
tips into a sort of fundamentalist

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:01.450 align:start position:19%
extremism in which it's not enough for

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:05.380 align:start position:19%
us to believe what we believe but we

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:07.390 align:start position:19%
start feeling obligated to you know hit

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:19%
you over the head because you don't

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:13.060 align:start position:19%
believe the same thing or to treat you

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.820 align:start position:19%
as as somebody who was less than that i

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:19%
am we had be more pro-science in America

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.660 align:start position:19%
if we were less religious don't you

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.650 align:start position:19%
think well you know what i think the the

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:27.390 align:start position:19%
the issues we have with science these

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:31.650 align:start position:19%
days are not

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.150 align:start position:19%
restricted to two what's happening with

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.970 align:start position:19%
respect to religion I there's a lot of

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:19%
free related scientists around i think

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:41.010 align:start position:19%
the problem is is that in our school

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.870 align:start position:19%
systems and to some degree and this is

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:46.080 align:start position:19%
where it is relevant with school boards

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:19%
around the country that are mandating

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:19%
curriculums and textbooks you start

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.830 align:start position:19%
seeing this weird watering down of

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.250 align:start position:19%
scientific fact

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:58.170 align:start position:19%
so that our kids are growing up in an

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.330 align:start position:19%
environment this connects with a 210

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:19%
saying earlier about the media where

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:08.280 align:start position:19%
everything's contested that that nothing

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:19%
is true because if it's on facebook

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.990 align:start position:19%
it all looks the same and if you're

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.530 align:start position:19%
reading something from a

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:21.870 align:start position:19%
nobel-prize-winning physicist next to

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:23.610 align:start position:19%
some guy in his underwear writing in his

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:19%
basement you know or his mom's basement

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:30.570 align:start position:19%
in context it it looks like it's equally

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.450 align:start position:19%
plausible and and part of what we have

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.460 align:start position:19%
to do a better job of if our democracies

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.490 align:start position:19%
of function in a complicated diverse

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:41.190 align:start position:19%
society like this is to teach our kids

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:48.840 align:start position:19%
enough critical thinking to be able to

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:52.470 align:start position:19%
sort out what is true and what is false

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:54.960 align:start position:19%
what is contestable and and what is

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:19%
incontestable and and we seem to have

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.630 align:start position:19%
have trouble with that and and are our

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:19%
political system doesn't help

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.750 align:start position:19%
okay i want to ask you this question

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.550 align:start position:19%
again it's an issue i think we don't get

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:19%
asked a lot about but it's important to

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.960 align:start position:19%
my audience and I know people will roll

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.550 align:start position:19%
their eyes and say so California ask

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:19%
this but food purity

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:19%
yeah something that means a lot to me

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:19.170 align:start position:19%
somehow it got to be elitist or liberal

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:19%
I don't get that to want food that isn't

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:19%
full of pesticides of food that wasn't

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:19%
created by torturing animals at in

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:19%
factory farms is in full of antibiotics

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:19%
which is a problem in itself

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.470 align:start position:19%
I feel like we're upside down on food we

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:19%
eat too much corn because we grow too

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.110 align:start position:19%
much corn because we subsidize too much

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.459 align:start position:19%
corn

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:19%
you know one of the problems with the

00:16:39.459 --> 00:16:45.970 align:start position:19%
Affordable Care Act is that people were

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:48.250 align:start position:19%
found to sikkre right than expected and

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.230 align:start position:19%
that's partly versus the food i think

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:19%
and obesity and all of work that

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.910 align:start position:19%
michelle has been doing yeah that one

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.529 align:start position:19%
didn't do food be put more at the top of

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:19%
the agenda when when we come to

00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:59.769 align:start position:19%
addressing health care

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:19%
there's no doubt about it that right now

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.410 align:start position:19%
we've got a disease care system we

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.730 align:start position:19%
should have a healthcare system and

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.630 align:start position:19%
healthcare system would include

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:19%
nutrition exercise but also quit pushing

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:12.939 align:start position:19%
back on corporal and and so angry I i

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:13.660 align:start position:19%
think what is true is that for a long

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:19.209 align:start position:19%
time

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:19%
agribusiness has a day obviously a

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:19%
prominent seat at the table in Congress

00:17:20.919 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:19%
it's bipartisan some of the reforms that

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.429 align:start position:19%
we've tried to initiate for example on

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.260 align:start position:19%
the school lunch program had actually

00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:33.820 align:start position:19%
made some progress on this front and

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.490 align:start position:19%
Michelle deserves a lot of credit for it

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:40.540 align:start position:19%
as do a bunch of organizations that have

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:43.270 align:start position:19%
worked on this deal

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:49.270 align:start position:19%
the the I think the strategy has to be

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:54.010 align:start position:19%
one of persuasion and has to be more

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:55.750 align:start position:19%
demand driven in the sense that one of

00:17:54.010 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:19%
the things Michelle's finding is that

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:19%
when she worked with walmart or craft or

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:19%
what have you and she said look here's

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.270 align:start position:19%
the data this is what parents want the

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.929 align:start position:19%
profit motive can actually work in favor

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:19%
of food purity as long as there's good

00:18:10.929 --> 00:18:15.580 align:start position:19%
information out there and so part of our

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.470 align:start position:19%
strategy has been how do we make sure

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.179 align:start position:19%
that consumers are aware they've got the

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.370 align:start position:19%
information they need

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:23.650 align:start position:19%
now i will tell you and this may be

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.020 align:start position:19%
controversial and in some your audience

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:28.419 align:start position:19%
it is important to look at the science

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.309 align:start position:19%
on this stuff so when it comes to

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:33.460 align:start position:19%
antibiotics for example the science is

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:19%
clear we pump our animals full of it and

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:39.220 align:start position:19%
and that's not just a problem in terms

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:43.210 align:start position:19%
of what we're in ingesting it's also a

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:45.250 align:start position:19%
problem that more and more you know

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:48.300 align:start position:19%
bacteria is becoming resistant resistant

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:19%
to antibiotics

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:55.560 align:start position:19%
but in some cases like for example the

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:19%
GMO debate it there are there areas

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.910 align:start position:19%
where there are legitimate concerns

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:19%
there are some areas where the science

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.590 align:start position:19%
seems to indicate well this is ok we

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.630 align:start position:19%
hand out back to the signs that says it

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.190 align:start position:19%
doesn't increase the year while exact

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.950 align:start position:19%
NAU's just as many if not more

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:19%
penetrating well that's so so my point

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:19%
is what that what we have to be make

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:19%
sure we're doing whether on the left or

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:19%
the right is being driven by the science

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.950 align:start position:19%
and if it turns out that some of these

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:30.270 align:start position:19%
genetically my modified foods aren't

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:19%
healthier aren't more productive and use

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:19%
more pesticides then we should follow

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.770 align:start position:19%
the science if in some cases they're not

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.540 align:start position:19%
causing any harm

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:19%
then we should follow the signs there as

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:19%
well and that's what what what I've

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:19%
tried to do in this administration is

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:51.270 align:start position:19%
and then this goes beyond just you know

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:55.710 align:start position:19%
nutrition policy what I always say to my

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:57.870 align:start position:19%
teams are figure out what is right as

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.430 align:start position:19%
far as as best we can tell figure out

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:19%
what the best policy is figure to hear

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.210 align:start position:19%
what the science tells us figure out

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.150 align:start position:19%
what the facts tell us what would what

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:19%
our best ideas out there and sort

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.230 align:start position:19%
through and then once you figure that

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.890 align:start position:19%
out then we'll worry about the politics

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:16.470 align:start position:19%
after that don't start with the politics

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:19%
and then try to get the facts to fit

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:25.230 align:start position:19%
into the politics and I think that if he

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:26.610 align:start position:19%
at minimum what that does is it keeps us

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.850 align:start position:19%
tethered to reality

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:31.680 align:start position:19%
it makes us go to bed that night feeling

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:19%
pretty good about it you know what we've

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:19%
been trying to do because we're not

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.490 align:start position:19%
constantly trying to tack to whatever is

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.750 align:start position:19%
fashionable and what public opinion

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:19%
you're out there we just try to figure

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:19%
out as best we can what is the right

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.550 align:start position:19%
answer and and nothing all of that you

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:19%
think we asked too little of the public

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:19%
politicians you know of course are

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:19%
always kissing up to the public and

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.770 align:start position:19%
saying things like if we only had a

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.389 align:start position:19%
government as good as the people but the

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.309 align:start position:19%
people aren't very well-informed

00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:01.229 align:start position:19%
they don't exercise their right to vote

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:04.589 align:start position:19%
and when they do they don't know much

00:21:01.229 --> 00:21:06.389 align:start position:19%
about it I just feel like we don't we

00:21:04.589 --> 00:21:08.669 align:start position:19%
don't ask the people very much were

00:21:06.389 --> 00:21:10.979 align:start position:19%
afraid to ask the people eat better you

00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:19%
know that the phrase was yes we can and

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.649 align:start position:19%
I feel like they're not pulling their

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:16.139 align:start position:19%
weight on the wii it's a partnership

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:18.479 align:start position:19%
with you eat better vote more learn

00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:22.139 align:start position:19%
something no III I actually think that

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:24.239 align:start position:19%
part of the pitch I've made throughout

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:28.079 align:start position:19%
my campaign throughout my presidency is

00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:30.329 align:start position:19%
exactly that that change doesn't come

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:32.849 align:start position:19%
from on high that if you're waiting for

00:21:30.329 --> 00:21:36.959 align:start position:19%
Congress then you're gonna be waiting a

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:40.889 align:start position:19%
long time even a pretty capable

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:43.589 align:start position:19%
well-meaning president is going to only

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:47.369 align:start position:19%
be able to take the country so far

00:21:43.589 --> 00:21:49.349 align:start position:19%
without people ordinary folks all across

00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:53.099 align:start position:19%
the country being engaged being involved

00:21:49.349 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:19%
being active I i constantly quote louis

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:56.429 align:start position:19%
brandeis who said the most important

00:21:54.659 --> 00:21:58.169 align:start position:19%
office in a democracy is the office of

00:21:56.429 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:19%
citizen it's not president it's not

00:21:58.169 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:19%
senator it's not mayor and so I have

00:22:03.659 --> 00:22:11.429 align:start position:19%
tried consistently to say to the

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:13.469 align:start position:19%
American people that this is only going

00:22:11.429 --> 00:22:16.109 align:start position:19%
to work if you're engaged now I will

00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:17.729 align:start position:19%
tell you having traveled every state met

00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:20.999 align:start position:19%
with people from every walk of life

00:22:17.729 --> 00:22:26.549 align:start position:19%
people are basically good

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:30.209 align:start position:19%
I you know I IMA my glass half full guy

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:32.969 align:start position:19%
and an optimist about the human spirit

00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:35.579 align:start position:19%
you are right though that people are

00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:19%
busy they're stressed and they don't

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:40.109 align:start position:19%
have time to follow the intricacies of

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:19%
some debate around Medicaid or what's

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:46.649 align:start position:19%
going on in Syria and so part of that

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:19%
but when i say i want a government as

00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:19%
good as the

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.620 align:start position:19%
the American people what i mean by that

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:59.419 align:start position:19%
is that i think people's instincts and

00:22:54.620 --> 00:23:01.070 align:start position:19%
their gut what that what they what they

00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:02.990 align:start position:19%
want out of life and how they want to

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:19%
see people treated is actually pretty

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:09.500 align:start position:19%
good but the question then becomes how

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:12.710 align:start position:19%
do we get enough information in front of

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.299 align:start position:19%
them to be able to make good decisions i

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.150 align:start position:19%
I've always believed that if i could get

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:19%
into you know if I could sit in the

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.340 align:start position:19%
living room whatever person in America

00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:24.860 align:start position:19%
over you know that I've got the majority

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.500 align:start position:19%
on my side and a healthy majority on my

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:19%
side on every issue that we work on just

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:19%
by having a conversation the problem is

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:19%
we got all these filters and look at my

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.860 align:start position:19%
watch fox news i wouldn't vote for me

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.350 align:start position:19%
either

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:39.049 align:start position:19%
right because you know you've got this

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:19%
screen this fun house mirror through

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:44.929 align:start position:19%
which people are receiving information

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.610 align:start position:19%
how did how to break through that is a

00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:53.029 align:start position:19%
big challenge that this whole

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:55.220 align:start position:19%
conversation has been had lately in in

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:59.630 align:start position:19%
the aftermath of the rise of Trump this

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:19%
notion that part of what's happened is

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.340 align:start position:19%
that both Republican and Democratic

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.830 align:start position:19%
elites have neglected the white

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:10.789 align:start position:19%
working-class the truth of the matter is

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:12.529 align:start position:19%
is that every policy i put forward would

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:14.510 align:start position:19%
make a huge difference with white

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:15.980 align:start position:19%
working class and the black working

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:19%
class and the Latino working class

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.149 align:start position:19%
whether it's raising the minimum wage or

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.350 align:start position:19%
the Affordable Care Act given people

00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:24.649 align:start position:19%
health care who don't have it and you're

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:28.130 align:start position:19%
working hard and and need help or making

00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:30.770 align:start position:19%
sure that unions are our strong so that

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:34.070 align:start position:19%
you can have a little more leverage at

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.750 align:start position:19%
the workplace or making sure that you

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.809 align:start position:19%
know something like the consumer finance

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.940 align:start position:19%
Protection Bureau is is Mei is

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:48.830 align:start position:19%
protecting against some scam mortgage

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:50.750 align:start position:19%
but what is true is that because it's

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.419 align:start position:19%
hard to get into the details of all

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.070 align:start position:19%
these issues with folks were

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:55.299 align:start position:19%
around dropping off their kids at school

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.259 align:start position:19%
and trying to punch the clock and

00:24:55.299 --> 00:25:00.669 align:start position:19%
figuring out how to make ends meet and

00:24:59.259 --> 00:25:03.070 align:start position:19%
just want to relax when they come home

00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:09.489 align:start position:19%
and not watch you know meet the press

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:13.269 align:start position:19%
then in that environment a lot of what

00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:19%
people take in is just symbols and

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:20.859 align:start position:19%
signifiers and you get into identity

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:23.710 align:start position:19%
politics and culture wars and and and

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:25.330 align:start position:19%
what I'd like to figure out and i think

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.820 align:start position:19%
democrats do have an affirmative

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:35.230 align:start position:19%
obligation to do that do this is is to

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:36.909 align:start position:19%
work harder to to to to figure out in in

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.139 align:start position:19%
this new age

00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:39.700 align:start position:19%
what's the equivalent of getting into

00:25:38.139 --> 00:25:41.230 align:start position:19%
people's living rooms and being able to

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.590 align:start position:19%
have a conversation and being able to

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.999 align:start position:19%
listen people and and and I've been able

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.489 align:start position:19%
to do this successfully during my

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:51.249 align:start position:19%
campaigns i have not always been able to

00:25:48.489 --> 00:25:52.989 align:start position:19%
do it is successfully here in this White

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.879 align:start position:19%
House partly because this bubble that's

00:25:52.989 --> 00:25:58.450 align:start position:19%
created around me

00:25:54.879 --> 00:26:00.519 align:start position:19%
there's American need to be an empire we

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.639 align:start position:19%
have more troops in more places than any

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:19%
Empire in the history of the world we

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:07.149 align:start position:19%
spent over six hundred billion on

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:09.700 align:start position:19%
defense and that's not including the

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:11.139 align:start position:19%
nukes taking care of veterans homeland

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.210 align:start position:19%
security when you add it all up it's

00:26:11.139 --> 00:26:17.889 align:start position:19%
probably over a trillion to keep the

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:20.830 align:start position:19%
monsters away i'm wondering if we could

00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:19%
be just to save spending half as much

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:26.109 align:start position:19%
eisenhower warned when he was close to

00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:27.429 align:start position:19%
the end of his second term like you are

00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:30.789 align:start position:19%
now about the military-industrial

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:33.340 align:start position:19%
complex and it seems no president of

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:19%
either party ever makes any progress on

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:19%
that pushing back on that will it ever

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:40.539 align:start position:19%
happened did you want to do that well

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.879 align:start position:19%
and look at that I had keep in mind

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:19%
billet when i came into office we had a

00:26:42.879 --> 00:26:47.260 align:start position:19%
hundred eighty thousand truths just in

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:54.460 align:start position:19%
Iraq and Afghanistan

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:19%
now we only have about 15,000 so that

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.750 align:start position:19%
that's pretty big

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.630 align:start position:19%
we still spend a bunch of folks still

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:06.970 align:start position:19%
spend morale you know actually are

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:13.690 align:start position:19%
spending I think his has been steady e

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:18.040 align:start position:19%
here's what I'd say that humility and

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:21.910 align:start position:19%
foreign policy is is a useful trait

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.070 align:start position:19%
particularly in the Oval Office think

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:27.010 align:start position:19%
bad things happen around the world and

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:30.730 align:start position:19%
our natural instinct is we should do

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:34.570 align:start position:19%
something there are times where our

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:37.750 align:start position:19%
intervention makes a difference but

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:19%
there are a lot of times where the

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:48.940 align:start position:19%
unintended consequences can result in

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:55.690 align:start position:19%
more problems when we intervene and

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:57.940 align:start position:19%
sorting out where those where those

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.290 align:start position:19%
issues play out is I think one of the

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:06.580 align:start position:19%
biggest challenges that any president

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:08.890 align:start position:19%
has my bias is that if it comes to

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:13.330 align:start position:19%
defending the American people against

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:18.010 align:start position:19%
al-qaeda ISIL somebody wants to blow up

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:19.990 align:start position:19%
a train station in midtown Manhattan

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:19%
that i'm going to go after them and I

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:27.610 align:start position:19%
make no apologies about it and I want a

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.800 align:start position:19%
vigorous military in place and when it

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:19%
comes to maintaining a basic

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.310 align:start position:19%
international order so that a guy like

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.990 align:start position:19%
Kim Jong on in North Korea doesn't

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:40.390 align:start position:19%
suddenly start holding all of Asia

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:42.250 align:start position:19%
hostage because he is building bunch of

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.740 align:start position:19%
nuclear weapons and and feels free to

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:19%
threaten everybody else it's important

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:19%
for us to have alliances in place and to

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.060 align:start position:19%
be able to work on the international

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.820 align:start position:19%
scene and us having the most powerful

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.040 align:start position:19%
military on earth helps that happen

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.980 align:start position:19%
it helps check the impulses of some

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.150 align:start position:19%
other

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:19%
bad folks and and i will tell you as

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:07.610 align:start position:19%
somebody who has now served as commander

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:19%
in chief for the last eight years not

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:13.790 align:start position:19%
only are the men and women in uniform

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:19%
that I work with extraordinary you know

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.110 align:start position:19%
you meet 23 year olds who are in charge

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:20.330 align:start position:19%
of life and death what missions and

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:23.630 align:start position:19%
maintaining billion-dollar pieces of

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:26.870 align:start position:19%
equipment and they just execute and do

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:31.250 align:start position:19%
it unbelievably well but what you also

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:34.040 align:start position:19%
discover is my top brass Joint Chiefs of

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.710 align:start position:19%
Staff they're not the chickenhawks who

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.980 align:start position:19%
are going around trying to get us into

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:43.220 align:start position:19%
every single war at you know the the

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:47.390 align:start position:19%
generals the cardinals the the the

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:49.130 align:start position:19%
commander's that I work with they know

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:19%
that the wages of war and they're

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.179 align:start position:19%
actually pretty thoughtful about it and

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.549 align:start position:19%
typically in the Situation Room they're

00:29:53.179 --> 00:29:57.020 align:start position:19%
the ones who are like well before we go

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:58.850 align:start position:19%
half-cocked on something

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.770 align:start position:19%
let's really think about this because

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:19%
this is what would be involved and they

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:07.130 align:start position:19%
have seen what what's involved because

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.040 align:start position:19%
most of them are people who were

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:19%
fighting in Iraq and fighting in

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.580 align:start position:19%
Afghanistan and they know how hard these

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:19%
environments are and and that no matter

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:18.049 align:start position:19%
how good our intentions a lot of times

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:22.280 align:start position:19%
they can go haywire

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:23.660 align:start position:19%
but having said all that I think we

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.730 align:start position:19%
should ever strength i think we should

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:28.730 align:start position:19%
have humility I think we have to

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:31.429 align:start position:19%
wherever possible work multilaterally

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.350 align:start position:19%
and not just unilaterally because if we

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:36.710 align:start position:19%
can't organize coalition's to do things

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:39.830 align:start position:19%
that means that maybe weren't we haven't

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:46.490 align:start position:19%
thought everything through having said

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:48.500 align:start position:19%
all that it turns out that is as flawed

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:52.850 align:start position:19%
as sometimes our foreign policy can be

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:55.460 align:start position:19%
or whatever blind spots we have we

00:30:52.850 --> 00:31:02.570 align:start position:19%
really are the indispensable nation if

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:06.710 align:start position:19%
we it if there is a no typhoon

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:19%
that wipes out someplace in Southeast

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:19%
Asia our military is the only

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:15.289 align:start position:19%
organization that has the infrastructure

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:18.950 align:start position:19%
to help those folks quickly when bola

00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:21.740 align:start position:19%
came out we actually had to build the

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:19%
platform whereby everybody else could

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:28.669 align:start position:19%
even think about bringing their doctors

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:19%
and nurses and if you have a rogue

00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:19%
nation that decided it was going to you

00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:43.730 align:start position:19%
know take action that that significantly

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:48.470 align:start position:19%
threatened a lot of people I'd want to

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:19%
know that the US military was there and

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:53.059 align:start position:19%
so and and i can tell you setting aside

our military power there's not an

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:58.730 align:start position:19%
international meeting i go to in which

00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:19%
if we weren't sitting at the table

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:06.980 align:start position:19%
nothing to get done because for the most

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:12.500 align:start position:19%
part other countries don't have either

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:14.029 align:start position:19%
the capacity or the inclination and when

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.389 align:start position:19%
you've got a bunch of authoritarian

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:19.460 align:start position:19%
governments out there and a creeping

00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:22.340 align:start position:19%
authoritarianism pulse around the world

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:28.250 align:start position:19%
we also are the ones who are pushing

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:30.590 align:start position:19%
back most effectively in perfectly but

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:33.740 align:start position:19%
most effectively against locking up

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:36.529 align:start position:19%
journalists and killing human rights

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:19%
activists and making sure that poor

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:43.730 align:start position:19%
people get food and dealing with public

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:46.520 align:start position:19%
health crises

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:53.210 align:start position:19%
I think if it if you see the world from

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:56.570 align:start position:19%
my seat I won't have sort of as assorted

00:32:53.210 --> 00:33:04.100 align:start position:19%
that the one thing I think is important

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:09.350 align:start position:19%
for progressives to guard against is a

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:15.140 align:start position:19%
tendency sometimes to not fully

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:18.920 align:start position:19%
appreciate that America is a bad guys

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:19%
trying that America's are pretty it is

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.870 align:start position:19%
not just a great nation in the sense

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:29.660 align:start position:19%
that it's powerful but that our values

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:32.420 align:start position:19%
and I rnr ideals actually matter and we

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.270 align:start position:19%
do a lot of good around the world and

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:44.420 align:start position:19%
there's some things that we do that are

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:46.340 align:start position:19%
either ineffective or imperfect but

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:19%
there's a lot to be proud of and there's

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.490 align:start position:19%
a lot to build on and now what we gotta

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.950 align:start position:19%
do is make sure that we get our own

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.570 align:start position:19%
house in order so that we can be and

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:59.630 align:start position:19%
they know you're off to Ohio right

00:33:53.570 --> 00:34:00.950 align:start position:19%
you've got an election to rig and I want

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.830 align:start position:19%
you I want you to get out there because

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:05.630 align:start position:19%
a boy it's it's a very nervous time for

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.640 align:start position:19%
us to people who are worried about mr.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:11.270 align:start position:19%
Trump that the stakes are high

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.980 align:start position:19%
I i know we you know we were getting the

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:16.130 align:start position:19%
we get in there

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:20.330 align:start position:19%
we're getting gone it but it's a but I

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:22.640 align:start position:19%
will say this that choice in this

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:25.580 align:start position:19%
election is should be really clear and

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:19%
apparent and anybody who's watching your

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:19%

compromising that you don't get a

sidelines right now or decided to engage

00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:30.759 align:start position:19%
in a protest mode that's a vote for

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:32.170 align:start position:19%
Trump and that would be badly damaging

00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:36.220 align:start position:19%
for this country and it would be damned

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:38.500 align:start position:19%
