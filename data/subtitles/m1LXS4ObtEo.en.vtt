00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.640
So this is Malia is going off to college,
and that's got to be.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.580
&gt;&gt; It's hard.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.780
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.960
That's got to be.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; Look.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.950
As Michelle reminds me,
our job is to prepare them not need us.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.730
And both my daughters
are wonderful people, and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.740
Malia is more than ready to leave.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.260
But I'm not ready for her to leave, and

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.070
I was asked if I would speak at her
graduation and I said absolutely not.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.860
Because I'm gonna be sitting
there with dark glasses sobbing.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.300
She's one of my best friends and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.950
it's gonna be hard for
me not to have her around all the time.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.370
But she's ready to go.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.790
You know you can tell when they're
she's just a really smart,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.760
capable person and
she's ready to make her own way.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.370
And they're
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.020
&gt;&gt; wonderful they're wonderful girls and I
&gt;&gt; Michelle gets all the credit,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.280
maybe an assist from my mother in law.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.010
But they really are just solid kids.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
They don't have an attitude,
they're courteous and kind to everybody.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.540
They work hard, they don't feel
like they're entitled to anything.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.860
&gt;&gt; Well, they have great parents.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.130
Both you and Michelle are really,
really amazing.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.170
Michelle Is such a strong,
wonderful role model for all women.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.480
And she has been a great First Lady.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.845
&gt;&gt; I agree, that I agree with.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:28.580
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.230
&gt;&gt; We have to take another break.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.780
&gt;&gt; That is indisputable.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.450
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.970
And you have been a great President.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.410
And like you said people can
say things over and over and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.940
over again about unemployment or
the economy or anything else.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.070
If you listen to that,
you're gonna believe it.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.650
If you look into it and see what
the facts are It's just not the truth.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.070
&gt;&gt; We're better off now
then when I came in.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.720
There's no doubt.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.542
&gt;&gt; You've done an amazing job.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:52.042
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
