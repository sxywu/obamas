00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.750
we've been able to


00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.909
we've been able to
systematically add additional

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.179
systematically add additional


00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:07.679

we're having to do is just


00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.329
we're having to do is just
systematically work through some

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:20.729
systematically work through some


00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399
systematically work through some
of the challenges of a big

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.799

were still taking appts down on


00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.780
were still taking appts down on
paper and when you've got

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.899
paper and when you've got


00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.429
paper and when you've got
millions of people who are

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.549
millions of people who are


00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.259
millions of people who are
needing services

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:36.659

it just doesn't work anymore so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.189
it just doesn't work anymore so


00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.679
it just doesn't work anymore so
we've now been able to cut down

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.829
we've now been able to cut down


00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.569
we've now been able to cut down
on waiting times reduce the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.719
on waiting times reduce the


00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.459
on waiting times reduce the
backlog for disability claims by

symptoms of Aden orange for the


00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.619
symptoms of Aden orange for the
first time to be able to make

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:55.679
first time to be able to make


00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.539
first time to be able to make
claims that added a couple

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.689
claims that added a couple


00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.639
claims that added a couple
hundred thousand people as we

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.789
hundred thousand people as we


00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.920
hundred thousand people as we
end to Wars folks come back so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.069
end to Wars folks come back so


00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.770
end to Wars folks come back so
we actually now have about 2.7

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.170
we actually now have about 2.7


00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749
we actually now have about 2.7
million more veterans seeking

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:06.149
million more veterans seeking


00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.979
million more veterans seeking
services and if the if the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.369
services and if the if the


00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.619
services and if the if the
amount of resources doesn't

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.019
amount of resources doesn't


00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.120
amount of resources doesn't
change then they get short

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.420
change then they get short


00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.530
change then they get short
changed

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.930
changed


00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.479
changed
so we've got to do efficiency

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.879
so we've got to do efficiency


00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.250

Congress to get out from under


00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.670
Congress to get out from under
this sequester this this idea

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.060
this sequester this this idea


00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.230
this sequester this this idea
that we just make blanket budget

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.560
that we just make blanket budget


00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.019
that we just make blanket budget
cuts that somehow that's going

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:25.230
cuts that somehow that's going


00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.929
cuts that somehow that's going
to improve our economy and that

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:27.329
to improve our economy and that


00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.590
to improve our economy and that
very same folks who are going to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.650
very same folks who are going to


00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.540
very same folks who are going to
cut services are the first ones

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.780
cut services are the first ones


00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.340
cut services are the first ones
than to say why is it that folks

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.639
than to say why is it that folks


00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.470
than to say why is it that folks
have waiting times along

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.870
have waiting times along


00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.639
have waiting times along
so it's a the waiting time issue

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:35.909
so it's a the waiting time issue


00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.319
so it's a the waiting time issue
to be fair as it happened far

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.680
to be fair as it happened far


00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.420
to be fair as it happened far
before the sequester and maybe a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.450
before the sequester and maybe a


00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.379
before the sequester and maybe a
bit brings up sort of a larger

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.739
bit brings up sort of a larger


00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.250
bit brings up sort of a larger
issue which is you know given

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.650
issue which is you know given


00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.929

does not have as larger role to

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:48.480
does not have as larger role to


00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.189
does not have as larger role to
play in our lives as the party

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.459
play in our lives as the party


00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.419
play in our lives as the party
that that you are with right

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:51.720
that that you are with right


00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660
that that you are with right
which means it's incumbent maybe

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.060
which means it's incumbent maybe


00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.560
which means it's incumbent maybe
upon that party the one that you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.680
upon that party the one that you


00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.019
upon that party the one that you
are with to demonstrate how that

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:58.349
are with to demonstrate how that


00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.000
are with to demonstrate how that
will work in the 21st century

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.030
will work in the 21st century


00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.789
will work in the 21st century

couldn't do it after a five
years went back and said let's

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:22.319
years went back and said let's


00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.739
years went back and said let's
do it separately more money

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.139
do it separately more money


00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.310
do it separately more money
