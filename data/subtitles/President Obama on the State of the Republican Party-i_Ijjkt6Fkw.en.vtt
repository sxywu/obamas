"Celebrity Apprentice."

Has Donald Trump called you
for advice

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.677 align:start size:75% position:25%
or talked to you at all?

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.279 align:start size:56% position:44%
And first of all,
you've given him

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.615 align:end position:100% line:91%
some pretty good advice
so far if you have.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:16.849 align:end position:100%
But has he called
and talked to you?

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.017 align:start size:56% position:44% line:91%

[ Chuckles ]

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
That was too easy.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:46.846 size:63% position:31%
But, the truth is,
actually,

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.480 size:84% position:42%
I am worried
about the Republican Party.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.251 size:78% position:39%
And I know that sounds...

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.619 align:start size:81% position:19% line:92%
You know.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.619 align:start size:25% position:75%
Yeah.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.121 size:63% position:31%
You know
what it sounds like.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.793 size:63% position:31%
But democracy works,
this country works

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:05.064 size:78% position:39%
when you have two parties
that are serious

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.166 size:63% position:31%
and trying
to solve problems.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.034 size:78% position:39%
And they've got
philosophical differences

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.403 align:end size:56% position:56%
and they have
fierce debates

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.504 align:start size:91% position:9%
and they argue

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.106 size:84% position:42%
and they contest elections.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.175 size:81% position:41%
But at the end of the day,
what you want

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.111 size:66% position:33%
is a healthy
two-party system.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.981 size:69% position:34%
And you want
the Republican nominee

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.451 size:75% position:38%
to be somebody who could
do the job if they win.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.855 size:78% position:39%
And you want folks
who understand the issues

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.692 align:start position:0%
and where you can sit
across the table from them

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.595 size:66% position:33%
and you have
a principled argument

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.830 size:78% position:39%
and ultimately can still
move the country forward.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.832 size:63% position:31%
So I actually
am not enjoying,

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.768 size:84% position:42%
and I haven't been enjoying
over the last seven years,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.869 size:63% position:31%
watching
some of the things

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.137 size:72% position:36%
that have happened
in the Republican Party

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.672 align:start position:0%
'cause there's some good people
in the Republican Party.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.642
There are wonderful Republicans
out in the country

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.943 size:63% position:31%
who want what's best
for the country

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.544 size:75% position:38%
and may disagree with me
on some things

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:55.114 align:end size:56% position:56%
but are good,
decent people.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:58.484 size:66% position:33%
But what's happened
in that party,

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.653 size:88% position:44%
culminating in this
current nomination, I think,

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.556 align:start position:0%
is not actually good
for the country as a whole.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.357 size:81% position:41%
It's not something
Democrats should wish for.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
And my hope is that

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.295 align:start size:97% position:3%
maybe once you get
through this cycle,

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.997 size:66% position:33%
there's some
corrective action

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.466 align:start position:0%
and they get back to being
a center-right party

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.502 size:78% position:39%
and the Democratic Party
being a center-left party

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
and we start figuring out
how to work together.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.875 align:start size:66% position:34%
Was it harder for you
going in as President

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.944 align:end position:100%
and realizing, well,
"People are gonna go,

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.646 align:start size:75% position:25%
like, not work with me"?

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.514 align:end position:100%
"The Republicans are not
gonna work with me."

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.550 size:66% position:33%
It exceeded
my expectations

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
because when I came in,
we were in the middle of crisis.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:35.488
And usually, your hope is that,
all right,

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.089 size:63% position:31%
we can play
political games,

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.324 size:81% position:41%
but when stuff is serious,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.394 size:66% position:33%
when we're losing
800,000 jobs a month,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:45.864 align:start position:0%
when we've got 180,000
troops in Afghanistan and Iraq

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.668
that we're going to buckle down
here for a second,

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.703 align:start position:0%
put the politics aside
and just get stuff done.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.238 size:75% position:38%
And that did not happen.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.973 size:63% position:69%
Like, what's the
Supreme Court thing?

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.274 size:84% position:58%
What's happening with that?

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.510 align:end position:100%
Because I know there's a seat
that needs to be filled.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.145 size:66% position:33%
So there's a good
case in point.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.715 size:66% position:33%
The Supreme Court
makes the law,

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.817 size:63% position:31%
interprets
the law of the land,

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.318 size:72% position:36%
and it's binding
all across the country.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start size:91% position:9%
And right now,

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.089 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to have
nine Supreme Court justices

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
because...

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.761 size:66% position:33%
You know, the passing
of Justice Scalia,

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.162 align:start size:97% position:3%
we only have eight.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.632 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so it's hard

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.066 size:66% position:33%
for the Supreme Court
to do its job.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.969 size:75% position:38%
Now, I've nominated
somebody who, uniformly,

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.738 size:69% position:34%

including Republicans,

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%

of probably

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:40.119 size:78% position:39%
the second-most important
court in the land.

he's got a good temperament,

with people
from all political spectrums.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.305 size:81% position:41%

won't even meet with them,

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.306 align:start position:0%

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.908 size:69% position:34%
they haven't given him
a hearing.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.409 align:start position:0%
And that's an example

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.679 size:72% position:36%
of where if the process
of democracy

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.315 size:63% position:31%
starts breaking down
to that degree

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.783 size:63% position:31%
where you can't even
show the courtesy

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
of meeting with a guy
who you know is qualified

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.421 size:69% position:34%
and you won't give him
a hearing

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.257 size:75% position:38%
because you want to wait

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.492 size:78% position:39%
and see if maybe your guy
wins the election

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.261 align:start position:0%
and nominates somebody,

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.765 align:start position:0%
then you start seeing
the court system breaking down.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.032 size:84% position:42%
You start seeing vacancies.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.568 size:72% position:36%

to the courts.

in ways
that's really unhealthy.

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:37.377 size:75% position:38%
So that's a good example
of my hope

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:41.046 size:78% position:39%
that the Republican Party
steps back and reflects

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.281 size:78% position:39%

we should be doing business
