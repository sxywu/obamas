00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.108 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN, I DIDN'T ASK YOU
HERE TO HELP.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.342
I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT
IN HERE.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.944 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: IT'S OKAY TO BE
NERVOUS.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:18.478 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.212

&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: 55.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.782
TOUGH TIME TO START OVER FOR A
MAN.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
I HAVE A COPY OF YOUR RESUME
HERE.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.120
WHY DON'T YOU HAND IT TO ME AS
IF YOU WERE APPLYING FOR A JOB.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.222 size:84% position:42%
GO AHEAD AND DO IT.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.022 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S GOOD.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.159
YOU'RE A NATURAL. OK.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.693 size:88% position:44%
HELLO, MR. O'BALMER.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.062
AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY?

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:09.629 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; CLOSE ENOUGH.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.765
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY. LET'S SEE,
PAPAPAPAPA I DON'T SEE ANY
PROMOTIONS FOR THE LAST EIGHT

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:13.600 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEARS.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.901
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS GOOD.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.003
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.873
&gt;&gt; HONESTLY, THERE WASN'T A LOT
OF ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT IN MY
LAST JOB.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.408
THE ONLY ONE WITH A MORE
POWERFUL POSITION WAS MY WIFE.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.076 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH OKAY.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.444 align:start size:88% position:13%
AH, GOOD.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start size:88% position:13%
UH-HUH.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
IS IT A TWOFER?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.313
CAN WE GET BOTH OF YOU, BY ANY
CHANCE?

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; DOUBTFUL.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.516 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.884
SO TELL ME WHY YOU'RE LEAVING.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.686
YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT BEING
TERMINATED, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU CAN'T STAY.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.389 align:start size:88% position:13%
IS THAT TRUE?

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.459
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'M LEAVING BECAUSE
IT'S REQUIRED BY THE 22ND
AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.926 align:start size:88% position:13%
CONSTITUTION.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:40.460 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.096 align:start size:88% position:13%
LITTLE TIP.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:46.399
WHEN YOU SAY STAYING IN YOUR JOB
WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHAT
EMPLOYERS HEAR IS THAT YOU STOLE

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.368 size:75% position:38%
OFFICE SUPPLIES.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.602 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY?

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.603
SO I'D GLOSS OVER THE REST OF
THAT, OK?

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.205 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:52.972 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: AND DOESN'T SAY
HERE.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:57.810 size:88% position:44%
WHERE WERE YOU BORN?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.080
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: IS THIS THE LONGEST
FORM OF THIS RESUME AVAILABLE?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.282
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE MOVE ON?

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.150
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, GOOD.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.353
DESCRIBE, IF YOU CAN, THE TYPE
OF OFFICE YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK
IN?

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.689
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WAS HOPING FOR A NICE
CORNER OFFICE.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.559
OR AT LEAST AN OFFICE THAT HAS
CORNERS IN IT.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR
ACCOMPLISHMENTS?

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.665
AND KEEP IN MIND IT'S IMPORTANT
TO DESCRIBE THEM IN SUCH A WAY
THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW YOUR

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.935
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO
A POTENTIAL EMPLOYER.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:27.340
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WELL-- I BROKERED
INTERNATIONAL DEALS THAT SLOWED
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.176
PREVENTED IRAN FROM ACQUIRING A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.612
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, LET'S CHANGE
THAT TO "PROFICIENT IN MICROSOFT
EXCEL."

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
ANYTHING ELSE?

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:39.152
&gt;&gt; WELL, I REOPENED RELATIONS
WITH CUBA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
50 YEARS.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.853

"CONVERSATIONAL SPANISH."

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
SI?

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.226
IT SAYS HERE-- LET ME SEE IF I
GOT THIS RIGHT.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.895 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT SAYS HERE YOU SAVED THE
AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.197
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT NOBODY BELIEVES IT.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:52.031
CHANGE THAT TO "DRIVES STICK."

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.732 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH, THAT'S GOOD.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.334 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S GOOD.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.268
IN CASE YOU WANT TO BE A LONG
HAUL TRUCKER.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.137 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.774
IT ALSO SAYS HERE YOU-- YOU
HELPED TENS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.308 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YOU BET.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, LET'S TEST
THAT OUT.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.378
IT HURTS WHEN I DO THIS?

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:06.079 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; DON'T DO THAT.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:06.713 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.948 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; WELL, I HAVE ALMOST 30
HONORARY DEGREES AND I-- I DID
GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:16.990
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH REALLY?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.024 size:81% position:41%
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:21.961
&gt;&gt; TO BE HONEST, I STILL DON'T
KNOW.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, GOOD.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.999 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.833
AND HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO FIRE
ANYONE?

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.001
&gt;&gt; NO I USUALLY LET SEAL TEAM
SIX HANDLE THAT.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:28.601
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, OUTSOURCING.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.168 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY GOOD.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.008 size:75% position:38%
DOES THAT COUNT?

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THAT'S VERY
IMPRESSIVE.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.509
HOW'D YOU GET SO MANY?

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.278 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; EXECUTIVE ORDER.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.779 size:84% position:42%

&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH, SMART.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:47.086
NOW, THESE DAYS EVERY BUSINESS
WANTS TO APPEAL TO THE
MILLENNIALS.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:47.787
YOU KNOW WHAT MILLENNIALS ARE.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:48.321 align:start size:88% position:13%

ELECTION OF THEIR LIFETIMES.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.432

TO MAKE HISTORY.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.368
AND THAT THE RESULTS IN NOVEMBER
COULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOREVER
SO THEY HAVE TO GET OUT THERE

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:07.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND VOTE.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.775
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: I'M SORRY.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.342
I DIDN'T CATCH ALL OF THAT.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.777
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A SNAPCHAT
FILTER THAT GIVES YOU A FLOWER
CROWN?

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.812 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I KNOW THAT,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.882
LET'S BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES,

WOULD YOU CARE FOR AN EXTRA
FIBER NUTRIENT BAR, WHICH HAS
TRAVELED TO MORE THAN ONE

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.646

YOU GET IN HERE?

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.432

QUESTION.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:12.999 align:start size:88% position:13%
