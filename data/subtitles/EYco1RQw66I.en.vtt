00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.833
- We need to talk about Selma.

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.733
The anniversary
was this past weekend,

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.700
and the whole family
went there.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.833
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.433
- And that must have been
really moving.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:09.566
- It was really powerful.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.033
I mean, just a reminder of,
you know,

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.133
the sacrifices people made
and the bravery they showed

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.266
to change the course
of history.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.200
And one woman was telling me
how she was 14 years old

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.833
when she marched.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.766
And she came on that day

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.300
just ready to have
her voice heard.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.966
But then she looked into
the faces of that angry mob,

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.200
and she said she was ready
to just turn around.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.900
She said, "I don't care
about any rights.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.700
I just can't do this."

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.900
And one of
the older marchers told her

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.633
that you cannot leave,

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.300
because if you run today,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.533
you'll be running from your
fears for the rest of your life.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.300
And she stayed,
and she marched on that day.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.433
I mean, that was--

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:54.366
You know, that was
a powerful day for us.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.633
- Yeah, I mean, I don't know
if you saw the movie "Selma,"

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.200
and if you haven't,
you should see it.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.966
It's so important,
and I thought

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.900
Oprah did a beautiful job
of the movie.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.233
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.100
And it reminds us
that we cannot take

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.900
our right to vote
for granted.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.633
- No.
- 'Cause too many people...

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:09.833
- No.

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.900
- Sacrificed for that right,
so...

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.500
- That, uh--Yeah.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.166
That scene in the movie
of them marching,

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.300
it's heartbreaking.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.700
It's really heartbreaking.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.300
And but to be there,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.600
and the President of the
United States standing there,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.300
that's--it's a powerful,
powerful day.
