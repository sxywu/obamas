00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.600
- Hi, Bellamy.
- What's going on?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.033
- What's going on?
- Oh, this, you know.

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.366
- So you're the famous
First Lady on television,

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.066
and then you just took a selfie
with the real First Lady.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.333
How cool was that?

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.433
- Surreal!
How crazy is this show?

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.633
How great is this show today?

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.300
[laughs]

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.333
Thank you for that.
We've only--

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.700
We've met one other time.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.533
I met her last year
around this time

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.066
at White House
Correspondents' Dinner.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.366
And Tony Goldwyn, who plays
my husband on the TV,

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.100
we got to sort of
go through a line

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.033
and meet them together.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.033
And the first thing
she said to me was,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.366
as we're walking
onto the dais, she says,

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.966
"Why did you kill
your son?"

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.433
And I was like...

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.833
I got really nervous,
and then I was like...

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.166
[stammering]

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.566
And I couldn't really get
any words out.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.066
So I was glad I got
to speak today.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.200
- Yeah.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.600
- And our sweet president
said to Tony,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.333
"Mr. President."
"Mr. President."

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.766
Like, that's how, like,
the whole--

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.233
And then the moment was over,
but it was amazing.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.566
I mean, isn't that amazing
that "Scandal" is so popular

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.800
that actually the president
is watching the show?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.166
- It's so surreal.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.466
Sweet Tina Tchen
who was here--

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.400
she's Michelle Obama's
Chief of Staff--

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.866
like, we were just
talking backstage.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.066
It's crazy that any of them
know who any of us are.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.733
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.
