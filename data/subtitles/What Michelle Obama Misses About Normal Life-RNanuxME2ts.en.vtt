00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.233
- So you're living in--
And I visited you there,

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.566
Portia and I and my brother,

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.433
and we were lucky enough
to go see you.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.366
But it's a big place.
Now--

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.666
- It's a big house.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.300
- First of all, are you used
to living in it by now?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.433
Do you get used to that?

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:13.766
- Yeah, yeah,
you absolutely do.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.100
I mean,
when we first moved in,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.466
it was like drinking
from a fire hydrant, you know?

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.566
Just everything coming at you,
trying to--

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.700
- Have you tried that before?
How would you know what that is?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.133
What a weird thing to do.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.666
- It's true.
I guess you're right.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.133
Let's just say it's hard.
It's really hard.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.733
It was hard.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.666
- And what will you
look forward to the most

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.866
when you're able to live
a somewhat normal life?

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.733
- You know, the one thing
people don't realize

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.566
is we can't do little things
like open windows.

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.766
You know?

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.833
I mean, I look forward
to getting in a car

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.000
and rolling down the window

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.733
and just letting the air
hit my face.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.333
I mean, I haven't been
in a car with the windows open

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.700
in about seven years,
if you can imagine that.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.800
- No.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.200
- So I'm gonna spend
that first year

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.066
just hanging out
the window.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.033
Just...I'll just...

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.133
Ah, the wind, you know?

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.933
- People driving by.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.400
"Was that Michelle?"

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.266
- Like, "She's hanging out
the window again."

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.966
- "Michelle was outside
the sunroof."

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.433
- "Get back in!"
- Yeah.

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.333
- I just want some wind
in my face.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.933
- Yeah, I don't--
- Small things.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.300
- You don't think about that.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.933
- Yeah, we can't open windows.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.133
I mean, the windows
in our house don't open.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:26.433
- But on "Scandal" they go
on the balcony all the time.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.266
You know?
- There is the balcony, yeah.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.700
That's real.
- So you can go on the balcony.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.366
- We do,
and go on the balcony,

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.933
but that's really the only door
we can open to the outside.

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.800
- Oh.
That's a bummer.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.066
- It's--
- Yeah.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.300
- It's interesting.
- Yeah, it really is.
