00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.200
We're back with the First Lady,
Michelle Obama, my co-host today.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.100
And it is pretty much a huge
deal that you're here.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.572
I just wanted to take advantage
of this before the show ends,

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:13.490
that I would maybe commemorate
this with a selfie or something.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.316
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I'd love to.

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:14.858
&gt;&gt; So.

00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:15.957
Uh-oh, I just messed it up.

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.422
&gt;&gt; Do you have the password?

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.484
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.945
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Wait, hold on.

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:21.445
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:22.412
&gt;&gt; I just need to need to get back to

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:24.700
the camera, that's all I have to do.
&gt;&gt; It is a one-hour show, Ellen.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.965
&gt;&gt; How do you?

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:26.875
Boy, you're doing great.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:27.440
&gt;&gt; I watch it.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.500
&gt;&gt; I lost the camera.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.505
There it is, there it is, okay.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:30.050
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.400
&gt;&gt; All right, hold on.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.365
&gt;&gt; A selfie means we're both in it, right?

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.980
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I need.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.445
&gt;&gt; We should do duck lips or something.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:45.413
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:46.780
&gt;&gt; You know who's better at this than me?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.500
Is Bradley Cooper.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.103
Bradley.

00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:58.103
[MUSIC]

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:20.530
&gt;&gt; Look at you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.079
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:21.721
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.109
Hey, it's Bradley Cooper, everybody.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.412
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; What a great start.

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:32.779
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:33.371
&gt;&gt; You guys are great.

00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:34.111
Aren't they fantastic?

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:38.440
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I gotta tell you,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.850
she has been begging me for
years to do this, and I was like, no, no.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.150
And then finally I'm like, okay.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.738
I guess so.
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for this.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.621
&gt;&gt; How many times have you
been at the White House?

00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:47.330
&gt;&gt; Twice.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.010
How many times have you been there?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.020
&gt;&gt; The state dinner, which is technically.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that counts, yeah.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.
I had just done American Sniper and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.190
the tuxedo,
I only had one tuxedo that didn't fit.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.662
And then, I was so
nervous that it would rip.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.745
So I decided the last minute
to eighty-six the underwear.

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:07.670
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Because you know, if it should rip,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.456
it's much better to not have underwear on.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:12.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; For us.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.102
[LAUGH] It's good for us, right ladies?

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:16.813
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
